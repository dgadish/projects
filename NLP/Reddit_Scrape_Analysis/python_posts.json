However, determining the correct neural network architecture for a particular task becomes time and resource-consuming because of the increasing complexity in their architecture. Complicated architectures also lead to difficulty in hyperparameter selection. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is highly encouraged for automating these selection choices. In May 2017, Google coined AutoML for its neural architecture search (NAS).

I'm developing a small python script / application that simply listens to all HTTP POST requests on some port, and will then take some appropriate action (forward it to another server, execute some script locally, etc). The important thing is that it will NOT provide any response to the sender of any such request, no webpages or files will be hosted, it will not use any kind of authorization, etc. It just listens to an http endpoint, looks at the string name of that endpoint (e.g. e[xample.com/this\\_is\\_my\\_endpoint\\_name](https://example.com/this_is_my_endpoint_name)), and will execute some predefined action.

Using e.g. nginx if I'm not even planning to send any response seems overkill and adds unwanted complexity. It's absolutely fine if my server would get overloaded and crash; I can always start it back up again.

I'm not at all an expert on web security, but I find it hard to imagine how any of my information could be exposed if I don't even send any kind of response back.

Multilint allows integrating a linter (or any other CQ (code quality)) tool by subclassing `ToolRunner` and implementing `ToolRunner.run()`.

I did a lot of profiling at my last job and I always thought that profiling tools provide a ton of value in terms of reducing latency and cutting cloud costs, but are very hard to use. With most of them you have to profile your programs locally on your machine. If you can profile in production, you often have to very lucky to catch the issues happening live, you can't just go back in time with these tools.\n\nSo I thought, why not just run a profiler 24/7 in production environment?\n\nI talked about this to a friend of mine and we started working. One of the big concerns we heard from people early on was that profilers typically slow down your code, sometimes to the point that it's not suitable for production use at all. We solved this issue by using sampling profilers \u2014 those work by looking at the stacktrace X number of times per second instead of hooking into method calls and that makes profiling much less taxing on the CPU.\n\nThe next big issue that came up was storage \u2014 if you simply get a bunch of profiles, gzip them and then store them on disk they will consume a lot of space very quickly, so much that it will become impractical and too expensive to do so. We spent a lot of energy trying to come up with a way of storing the data that would be efficient and fast to query. In the end we came up with a system that uses segment trees \\[1\\] for fast reads (basically each read becomes log(n)), and tries \\[2\\] for storing the symbols (same trick that's used to encode symbols in Mach-O file format for example).\n\nAfter we did all of this we ran some back of the envelope calculations and the results were really good \u2014 **with this approach you can profile thousands of apps with 100Hz frequency and 10 second granularity for 1 year and it will only cost you about 1% of your existing cloud costs (CPU + RAM + Disk).** E.g if you currently run 100 c5.large machines we estimate that you'll need just one more c5.large to store all that profiling data.\n\nCurrently we have support for Go, Ruby and Python and the setup is usually just a few lines of code. We plan to release eBPF, Node and Java integrations soon as well.\n\nWould love to get your feedback on our work so far. Even better, we would love to hear about the ways people currently use profilers and how we can make the whole experience less frustrating and ultimately help everyone make their code faster and cut their cloud costs."}, "294": {"title": "Learning Python For Ethical Hacking", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "7", "num_comments": "4", "created_utc": "1612111493", "selftext": "I just posted this article explaining how can Python be used for ethical hacking and penetration testing so i hope you guys enjoy it \n\nQuick note.

All you need to do is launch it via `dtaledesktop` and plug in the code for producing the DataFrame. That widget will be present every time you launch dtaledesktop, and by simply clicking a button you can run that code and analyze the resulting DataFrame in [dtale](https://github.com/man-group/dtale) or [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling),\n\nCode snippets can be added or edited directly from the dashboard, and upon doing so the dashboard is immediately updated. It also automatically caches data to improve performance.\n\nDtale-desktop can be run both locally and as a web service -- the demo site is actually running on a kubernetes cluster. When run as a web service, it uses websocket connections to push real-time updates, ensuring that all connected users see the same thing. There are a large number of settings which can be used to configure exactly how it behaves, documented [here](https://github.com/phillipdupuis/dtale-desktop#settings).\n\nAnd lastly, if anyone is curious, it works by essentially running two web apps in parallel. The main one has an async FastAPI backend and a react frontend, and it is responsible for displaying the dashboard, executing your code, and launching/killing dtale instances. The second app is a dtale server. These apps run in different threads and listen on different ports, which allows the async FastAPI app to run without the event loop being blocked by the synchronous dtale app."}, "344": {"title": "How to play a Sound in Spyder?", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1612036033", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI tried so many codes found on internet but none of them worked.

Tonight I've decided to throw a little after party python competition for any of you Pythonistas out there who want to test yourself against the world. Plus, I want to give some love to all my nerdy friends out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**When does it start?** We'll present the challenge on stream after we get through the function material. Once the challenge is presented you can start solving. \n\n**How do you win?** The first person to post their *working code* (not the answer to the challenge!) in the discord wins. \n\n**What do you win?** I'm thinking a Steam gift card or game, something in the neighborhood of 20-40 wingwangs depending on how hard we make the challenge and how cool your solution is! Who knows, maybe there will be a reward for the craziest solution. . . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoin the fun tonight here: [M1N1M00SE](https://www.twitch.tv/m1n1m00se) (6PM EST)\n\nJoin the very small discord community here: [Minimoose Lodge](https://discord.gg/3hUqkrz5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: We're open to suggestions if you want to make this an even cooler event in the future. Love all you Pythonistas out there. Keep on learning!!"}, "423": {"title": "Programmable WiFi connected device with buttons", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1611945192", "selftext": "[removed]"}, "425": {"title": "Give me a challenge !!", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1611941908", "selftext": "[removed]"}, "426": {"title": "[Urgent]SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Unrecognized token '&lt;'", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1611941455", "selftext": "[removed]"}, "430": {"title": "Want your own Telegram Userbot made from Python, Shock your Friends and Family by this big move.", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "0", "created_utc": "1611938504", "selftext": "So actually this bot can do many of the things which we humans want in our life, like it will personally assist you and manage all of the things related with you.\n\nSounds interesting, just see what more this bot can do- [https://youtu.be/tJzmrTq09tA](https://youtu.be/tJzmrTq09tA)"}, "433": {"title": "Recommendation for a python course on Linkedin learning", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1611936401", "selftext": "[removed]"}, "434": {"title": "Making spambot for Whatsapp, instagram, youtube, and almost for every platform where text is allowed.[For Beginners]", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "1", "created_utc": "1611935017", "selftext": "Hey everyone, so i thought that day by day many people are coming towards the coding languages and python is a very great step to choose first.\n\nSo for beginners who want to have a little fun with python language, here it is explained how to make your friends amazed by this Spambot, made using Python.\n\nHere is the link to that tutorial- [https://youtu.be/aOv4EWJ778I](https://youtu.be/aOv4EWJ778I) ..."}, "435": {"title": "Are executables generated by .py files as fast as the interpreter or are they faster?", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "3", "created_utc": "1611933541", "selftext": "I've recently came across with the pyinstaller software.

Modularyze ([repo](https://github.com/jungerm2/modularyze), [documentation](https://modularyze.readthedocs.io/en/latest)) is a new library that enables dynamic YAML-based configurations. It brings the power of dynamic templating (provided by Jinja2) to configuration files, which enables multi-file, parametrizable and fully-instantiable configurations.\n\nConsider this small example from the README. If you have the following config file named 'imagenet.yaml':\n\n    {% set use_pretrained = use_pretrained | default(True) %}\n    {% set imagenet_root = imagenet_root | default('datasets/imagenet') %}\n    \n    network: &amp;network\n        !torchvision.models.resnet18\n        pretrained: {{ use_pretrained }}\n    \n    val_transforms: &amp;val_transforms\n        !torchvision.transforms.Compose\n        - !torchvision.transforms.Resize [256]\n        - !torchvision.transforms.CenterCrop [224]\n        - !torchvision.transforms.ToTensor\n    \n    dataset: &amp;dataset\n        !torchvision.transforms.datasets.ImageNet\n        args:\n          - {{ imagenet_root }}\n        kwargs:\n          split: 'val'\n          transforms: *val_transforms\n\nYou'll be able to instantiate it like so:\n\n    import torchvision\n    from modularyze import ConfBuilder\n    \n    builder = ConfBuilder()\n    builder.register_multi_constructors_from_modules(torchvision)\n    conf = builder.build('imagenet.yaml')\n\nAnd just like that, conf will be a dictionary containing the instantiated network object, dataset object, etc. Note that this library was developed for use with ML, but it can just as easily be used in a different setting.\n\nThere are a bunch more use cases and features that are described in the docs, so I'd encourage you to take a look, and leave your thoughts and suggestions below!

I'm not affiliated with this project, just an excited future user waiting for the crowdfunding campaign for the hardware to finish so I can get my hands on one and start using it, and maybe contributing to the project.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/GlasgowEmbedded/glasgow\nCrowd Supply Campaign: https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/glasgow\n\nThe Glasgow Interface Explorer is a completely re-configurable interface for digital I/O, both input and output, including automatic voltage level sensing and independently controllable voltage levels for two different I/O banks. It uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array; essentially a re-configurable array of digital logic elements that you can use to form different high-speed digital circuits at run-time) and high-speed (480 Mb/s) USB to allow it to interface with a pretty wide variety of protocols, even unusual ones with tight timing requirements.\n\nThis is something that you would use if you're trying to interface to some obscure piece of hardware, or just generally if you're doing many kinds of digital hardware work and need an adapter to probe, test, inject messages, program an EEPROM or flash, or the like.\n\nAnd one of the really interesting parts is that is can achieve this flexibility by using the first fully open source FPGA toolchain, yosys, so that there are no proprietary tools needed for reprogramming the FPGA. Most FPGA vendors sell commercial tools for programming their chips, which limits the ability to allow users to re-program and re-configure on the fly.\n\nThe software is all built using Python; there's a Python based HDL (hardware description language, which describes the digital circuits), nMigen, that allows writing easy to reuse digital blocks for the FPGA, as well as the host side code. This means that you can actually program the reconfigurable digital logic in the FPGA using only Python.\n\nSo it can be used as a logic analyzer, USB to almost anything interface (within its specs, of 1.8 to 5 V levels, and max of 100 MHz signals), reverse engineering tool, programmer/debugger, or all kinds of other things. Sort of an ultimate digital Swiss army knife.\n\n(I'm not sure the appropriate flair for this, it's an open source project and crowdfunding campaign that I'm not directly involved with but I think is really interesting, mods feel free to let me know if I need to re-flair or re-post in a different way)"}, "588": {"title": "Is there anyone who is willing to code a few discord bots/scanners for the stock market for me?", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "0", "num_comments": "16", "created_utc": "1611783080", "selftext": "If it works I am willing to pay you $20 per bot!

However, when simply reading source code it can be hard to see the forest from the trees, which is why I've created a small library for exactly that purpose.

Best to show some output right away:\n\n[sphinx-autodoc-typehints](https://preview.redd.it/fs5dsozoujd61.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d19e98dc82a39c75623c8248f187709667a4001c)\n\nThe example was generated from a single-file 3rd-party Sphinx extension \"sphinx-autodoc-typehints\". It shows clear structure: a single top level function with a clean processing hierarchy. A substantial, completely separate section on the left under \"format\\_annotation\" could for example be an ideal candidate for a sub-module, should the need to refactor arise. For a first-time reader, this is very insightful and intuitive when compared to reading 400+ loc thouroughly.\n\nA more useful example can be found in Pydot (2k loc). The nodes have two attributes: shape and color. Shape is determined by the type of node: class, function, variable etc. Color is determined by the number of connections that a node has. Blue and green are for root and leaf nodes, respectively, while levels of red are used to visualise busy hub nodes.\n\n[pydot](https://preview.redd.it/5sq6tavayjd61.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e0f1b85d079ea7c6d5b4ad0cd45b4dec9b6e9a)\n\nYou can find more examples of popular libraries in our [RTD gallery](https://pyfactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html), or try it out on your own sources by installing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyfactor/).\n\nThis library came about when I tried to introduced myself to Black's single-file code base - [6000 lines of horror](https://pyfactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/black.html). I'm not here to diss Black or its contributors, 6k loc is more than enough to be complex anyway, but the graph reveals that complexity at a glance. My hope is that it will be particularly useful for those that need to get an understanding of a code base fast, those newer programmers that want to understand their own code and how to make it better, and as a tool for refactoring in general. It's no miracle worker, but I think it could have potential as a tool for making the right decisions.

We make it easy to scale from laptop to cluster, without requiring any devops work.\n\nGarnet plugs into any existing Python environment (notebook, IDE, CI/CD pipelines, custom apps) using a lightweight client library, and enables users to scale popular data/ml libraries (including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.) and custom code to a remote cluster for execution. Under the hood, we natively wire up Dask with Kubernetes for scheduling, which brings advantages such as dynamic resource allocation, ephemeral clusters and autoscaling, while abstracting the devops complexity for developers and data scientists.\n\nOur vision is to build the orchestration layer for distributed computing in Python. We\u2019re starting off with Dask, but have goals of supporting other frameworks such as Ray and Modin in the future.\n\nSome of the cool use cases we\u2019ve seen from our users are:  \n\\- Bursting to the cloud from local dev environments for data and memory intensive computations\n\n\\- Standing up managed Dask and Kubernetes clusters programmatically in 3-4 lines of Python, without any devops knowledge (Docker, k8s etc.)\n\n\\- Parallelize existing codebases in pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost etc. with minimal code changes, without opting for a more complex system such as Spark\n\nCurrently, users can download our client library and run Dask workloads on our hosted and managed cluster for free (see [docs](https://docs.garnet.ai/)). We\u2019re working on adding the capability to run Garnet on your own cloud (Kubernetes) in an upcoming release.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to hear your feedback, and what you\u2019d like to see.

I recommend using PyPy for speed though.\n\nThe version I linked above doesn't use any libraries aside from time, math, random, and sys. Notably, it doesn't use GPU calls or math libraries like numpy. I've also made a separate version that uses the multiprocessing module, and another version that offloads rendering to a C extension I made.\n\nThe mathematics and geometric primitives in the ray tracer actually allow it to render in higher than 3 dimensions. One of the images on my page shows 4D cubes. Unfortunately, I think that most 4D scenes would need to be animated to be very interesting, so I haven't tried many renders in higher dimensions.\n\nThe ray tracer supports reflection, refraction, subsurface scattering, and any material can emit light.

I've done a fair amount of work with asyncio so I'm relatively familiar with common patterns and frustrations.  It seems that the community thinks that asyncio could be improved, but since it's the standard library module it is the defacto choice.  I believe the hope was that asyncio didn't have to be the only API, but ideally other frameworks would use the same event loop.\n\nNow today we have other great tools such as trio, which brings much needed features like task groups, cancel contexts, timeouts, exception groups, and more.  However it seems that trio is inherently incompatible with the asyncio loop, requiring imperfect shims for interoperability.  Some of those features, like exception groups, may make their way into future python versions (hoping for 3.10!).  However the path for many of these improvements is probably far in the future for the stdlib.\n\nThere are other projects such as anyio, which give the programmer generic tools for implementing trio-like concepts for either framework.  This seems good but still requires one or the other event loop, so you must choose to run either asyncio or trio under the hood.  Is python going the direction of requests, where nobody uses urllib, but for async?\n\nSo it seems to me that a new project had the following choices for direction:\n* Use stdlib asyncio\n* Use asyncio with third party extensions like anyio.\n* Use trio, and probably trio-asyncio to bridge the gap with existing asyncio libraries.\n\nSo, what do you think is the right choice for a new project that needs to be maintained for a long time?  What's best for long term stability, features, and developer happiness?  What would you choose?\n\nCheers"}, "936": {"title": "Anaconda Navigator's python not working...", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1611204113", "selftext": "[removed]"}, "937": {"title": "Python for loop help.", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "2", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1611200875", "selftext": "[removed]"}, "938": {"title": "Python For loop help needed.", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "2", "created_utc": "1611198903", "selftext": "[removed]"}, "939": {"title": "Looking for someone who wants to work on a fantasy basketball script", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "1", "created_utc": "1611196315", "selftext": "The Yahoo app is terrible in my experience for some reason with basketball.

You can define sample objects and check objects against them, and if the type checking fails, you'll get very exact error messages telling you why it failed!\n\nHere's a quick example of how a sample object would look, and then an object which would pass the type checking!\n\n    from pytechecker import check\n    \n    sample = {\n        \"name\": {\n            \"required\": True,\n            \"allowed_types\": [str]\n        },\n        \"age\": {\n            \"required\": True,\n            \"allowed_types\": [int]\n        }\n    }\n    \n    obj = {\n        \"name\": \"dcronqvist\",\n        \"age\": 21\n    }\n    \n    # succ will be True if it passed type checking\n    # errors will be an array of strings that tell you\n    # what went wrong during type checking, if succ is False.\n    succ, errors = check(sample, obj)\n\nTake a look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcronqvist/pytechecker) if you want to see more examples!

Thus I can just use the command dig on linux to send messages to my server, from everywhere in the world, which is the main point for this project: DNS requests are often unfiltered (that doesn't mean they aren't logged by your ISP !! the goal of the project isn't to avoid log but firewall filters), thus when you have a limited connection (no access to internet), oftentimes DNS requests can still go out on the internet. Which is very interesting (but slow) to communicate from an airplane to someone on Earth, if you don't want to pay $50 to have 2GB of Wifi on the plane.

If I talk about the small businesses there you have small amount of Data that you write on the **Excel** and then you will compute the results. **By those results you can calculate the growth of that business** or what the things are required to improve the business. But if I talk about the big businesses or the big firms Like Google , Apple or many others they have large amount of Data . **They can not compute that Data on Excel or can not gather information just by those traditional methods** . So , here **Data Science** comes in the pictures .\n\n**Data Science is used to do the same task but in the modern way** and for the businesses that have the large amount of Data. By that Data, Company can do a lot of things but the one major thing is to improve their businesses statistics and the creativity they can generate for the growth . So, that's why\u00a0 there is a big need of Data Science .\n\n### Work of a Data Scientist\u00a0\n\nThere are various tasks that can be done in the **Data Science** :-1. Data cleaning:-\u00a0 **Data cleaning** is performed after we get the Data from a particular task . In Data cleaning we have a large amount of Data , So there will be inconsistency in the Data and other difficulties that a **Data scientist** has to solve and extract the right information to use.  \nAfter this many other processes happen like Data loading where Data is loaded after the cleaning of Data then there Data processing happens to gather some useful information and visualize that . \n\n \n\n## Free Data Science Courses\u00a0\n\nOn the web you will find various **Data Science courses** most of them are paid . There are some highly authorized platform like Coursera , Udemy , EDX etc.  \nBut if you want to learn it for free then you can check these that are mentioned below .\u00a0 The first platform is\u00a0\n\n### 1. Cognitiveclass.ai\n\nHere you can learn various technical stuff like **Python, AI, Cloud, Blockchain** etc. So this is the first web platform where you can learn **Data Science for free.**\u00a0\n\nHere you will get the complete course of Data Science. On this platform you will see the Course name\u00a0 **Python for Data Science**. There you will get textual stuff for reading and there you will get videos to learn .\n\n### 2. Kaggle\n\n **Kaggle is also a good platform to learn Data Science for free** in the image you can see the interface of website . Here you will get the various courses like **Deep learning , Machine learning , Artificial intelligence etc**. You can learn Data Science here for free , you can find various concepts to learn . There you will find some practical exercises to improve skill on the scale of practical implementation of Data Science. \n\nofficially posted [here](https://infocornerss.blogspot.com/2021/01/free-data-science-courses.html)."}, "1065": {"title": "I have made a discord bot for an educational environment!", "subreddit": "Python", "score": "1", "num_comments": "0", "created_utc": "1611058133", "selftext": "I have created a discord bot with the [Discord.Py](https://Discord.Py) library which is focused on a school environment.

They asked if I could make a webscraper to get previous sale prices off of a different marketplace/price guide site for them. Easy enough, so I started making a webscraper using python \u00d7 selenium.
