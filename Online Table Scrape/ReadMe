This was a short project to practice scraping a table from the web. Specifiaclly, the tables were taken from the UFC fighter stats pages which can be found at 
http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters?char=a&page=all. The tables were scraped using the pandas.read_html() method. The tables were then combined and cleaned 
in preparation for visualisation.
