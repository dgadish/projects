This code is for the first milestone project in the Udemey '2020 Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero to Hero in Python' course led by Jose Portilla. 
I attempted the project with as little guidance as possible from the course notes. 
I took some guidance from the walk through notebook provided which can be found at 
https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp/blob/master/04-Milestone%20Project%20-%201/02-Milestone%20Project%201%20-%20Walkthrough%20Steps%20Workbook.ipynb

Having gone through the solution provided, there are some similarities and some differences between my code and the solution.
In general, the given solution is sleeker and more efficient, especialy in the game script. However, I believe a few of my custom functions are on par with those given.

The code successfuly produces a naughts and crosses or 'tic tac toe' game.
It allows players to choose 'X' or 'O'.
It gives a key at the start to show which inputs relate to which positions on the board.
It randomly selects who goes first.
It checks for winning moves and for a full board.
It congratulates the winner and gives the option to play again.
