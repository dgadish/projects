It is extremely popular in technology and startup circles and posts that make it to the top of the listings can recieve large numbers of visistors as a result.\n",

However, for the purposes of the project, a reduced version has been provided by [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/jupyter/edit/notebook/hacker_news.csv). This reduced version brings the data from approximately 300,000 rows to around 20,000 by removing submissions with no comments and then randomly sampling the remaining submissions.\n",

    "This project aimed to compare the popularity of commenting on 'ask' and 'show' posts and then determine what is the best time to post in order to receive comments on a post. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, submissions starting with `'Ask HN'` and `'Show HN'` were separated from the rest of the data and then the average number of comments was calculated for both. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was found that 'ask' posts received more comments on average with 14.04 (2s.f.) compared to 10.32 (2s.f.) of 'show' posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis was then focused on the 'ask' posts. Frequency tables were created and then sorted to calculate and determine the average number of comments on an 'ask' post according to the hour it was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to the conclusion that the best time to post is from 8:00 - 9:00 pm GMT, with an average of 38.59 (2s.f.) comments per post for posts created during that time period."
